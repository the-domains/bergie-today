  You don't have to be an expert on digital currencies like bitcoin to be
  intrigued by the potential of the technology underlying them. Blockchain, as
  it's called, is something new in computing. It mashes up cryptography and
  peer-to-peer networking to create what amounts to a shared database of
  transactions and other information-which can be open to all, controlled by no
  one.
