    description: '"Science often follows technology, because inventions give us new ways to think about the world and new phenomena in need of explanation." Or so Aram Harrow, an MIT physics professor, counter-intuitively argues in " Why now is the right time to study quantum computing ".'

description: "Artificial Neural Networks have spurred remarkable recent progress in image classification and speech recognition. But even though these are very useful tools based on well-known mathematical methods, we actually understand surprisingly little of why certain models work and others don't. So let's take a look at some simple techniques for peeking inside these networks."
