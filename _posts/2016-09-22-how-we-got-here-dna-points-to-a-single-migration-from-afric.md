  Each team of researchers tackled different questions about our origins, such
  as how people spread across Africa and how others populated Australia. But all
  aimed to settle the controversial question of human expansion from Africa. In
  the 1980s, a group of paleoanthropologists and geneticists began championing a
  hypothesis that modern humans emerged only once from Africa, roughly 50,000
  years ago.
