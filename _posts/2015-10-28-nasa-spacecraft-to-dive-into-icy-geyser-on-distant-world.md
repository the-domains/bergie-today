description: "On Wednesday, a school-bus sized spacecraft will dive out of the inky blackness of space more than one billion kilometers from Earth and zip through an icy plume that springs from the south pole of Enceladus. Although it's just a tiny satellite of Saturn-less than one-sixth the size of Earth's moon-Enceladus has become one of the most intriguing bodies in the Solar System."
