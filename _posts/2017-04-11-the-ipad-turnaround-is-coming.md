  On the one hand, we have iPad plummeting sales, dropping 50% in three years.
  On the other, we have Apple's professed high optimism, without much proof
  besides some new - and clever - ads, and the recent discreet release of
  evolutionary and slightly less expensive hardware. Is that all? The iPad is a
  strange animal, confounding explanations and expectations.
