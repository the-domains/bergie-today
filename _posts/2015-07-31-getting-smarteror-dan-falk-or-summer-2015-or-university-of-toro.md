    description: "The best way for AI machines to learn is by feeding them huge data sets of annotated examples, and the Daily Mail has unwittingly created one. A revolution in artificial intelligence is currently sweeping through computer science. The technique is called deep learning and it's affecting everything from facial and voice to fashion and economics."
