  By the time European explorers reached the islands scattered across the vast
  distances of the Pacific Ocean, most of the voyaging done by the Polynesians
  was among local island groups. But the locals seemed to know of places well
  beyond their shores, which suggested their ancestors not only colonized
  far-flung islands, but returned to share knowledge of them.
