  There are a few mummies in the world as old as Ötzi, but none so well
  preserved. Most were ritually prepared, which usually meant removal of
  internal organs; preservation with chemicals; or exposure to destructive
  desert conditions. The glacier not only froze Ötzi where he had died, but the
  high humidity of the ice also kept his organs and skin largely intact.
