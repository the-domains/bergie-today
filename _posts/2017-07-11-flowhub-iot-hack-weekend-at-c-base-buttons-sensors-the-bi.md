  Last weekend we held the c-base IoT hack weekend, focused on the Flowhub IoT
  platform. This was continuation from the workshop we organized at the Bitraf
  makerspace a week earlier. Same tools and technologies, but slightly different
  focus areas. c-base is one of the world's oldest hackerspaces and a crashed
  space station under Berlin.
