  Tablets were supposed to be the future. They were supposed to get us off the
  desk and away from the laptop, and usher us into a touch-enabled world of
  productivity and entertainment. A dream of computing where our devices
  seamlessly blend between activities and go wherever we need them to. But the
  tablets we know, the iPads and Surfaces of the world, haven’t really lived up
  to that dream, whether it’s because doing actual work on them is harder than
  it should be, or because they are barely different than the PCs we’ve used for
  years.
