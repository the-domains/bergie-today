  Back in 2013 I was working exclusively on an Android tablet. Then with the
  NoFlo Kickstarter I needed a device with a desktop browser. What followed were
  brief periods working on a Chromebook, on a 12" MacBook, and even an iPad Pro.
  But from April 2016 onwards I've been again working with an Android device.
