    description: "We haven't designed fully sentient artificial intelligence just yet, but we're steadily teaching computers how to see, read, and understand our world. Last month, Google engineers showed off their \"Deep Dream,\" software capable of taking an image and ascertaining what was in it by turning it into a nightmare fusion of flesh and tentacles."

    description: "Kurzweil argues that you have interlocked curves, so even after silicon tops out there's going to be something else. Maybe he's right, but right now that's not what's going on, so it unwinds a lot of the arguments about the future of computing and the impact of computing on society."
