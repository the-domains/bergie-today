  Google is making it easy to digitize and share old photos with a new app
  called PhotoScan - just in time to embarrass you for the holidays. PhotoScan
  is an app that lets you take a picture of a physical, old photo. While the
  user interface is simple enough for anyone to use, there’s a great deal going
  on in the background. The app uses machine learning to remove glares, crop out
  the desk or wall behind the printed photo, and make sure the colors are
  accurate so that you get a perfect scan.
