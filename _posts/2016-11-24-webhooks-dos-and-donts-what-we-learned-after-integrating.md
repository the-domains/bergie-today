  As modern applications are becoming more and more a composite of APIs and the
  serverless architectures are getting more attention, API providers can't
  afford any longer to expose only traditional REST endpoints. Traditional REST
  API are designed for when you want to allow a programmatical retrieve or post
  content, far from being optimal when you just want your application to be told
  when something changed.
