  Benches in parks, train stations, bus shelters and other public places are
  meant to offer seating, but only for a limited duration. Many elements of such
  seats are subtly or overtly restrictive. Arm rests, for instance, indeed
  provide spaces to rest arms, but they also prevent people from lying down or
  sitting in anything but a prescribed position.

<article style=""><h1>Unpleasant Design &amp; Hostile Urban Architecture</h1><p>Benches in parks, train stations, bus shelters and other public places are meant to offer seating, but only for a limited duration.
