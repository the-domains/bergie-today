  After several months of work, NoFlo 0.8 is finally out as a stable release.
  This release is important in that it brings the Process API for NoFlo
  components to general availability, paving way for the 1.x series. We
  introduced Process API in the 0.7 series last summer, but at that stage it
  wasn't deemed good enough for production use.
