    description: 'Few people in the tech world can truly be said to "need no introduction." Stephen Wolfram is certainly one of them. But while he may not need one, the breadth and magnitude of his accomplishments over the past four decades invite a brief review: Stephen Wolfram is a distinguished scientist, technologist and entrepreneur.'

description: "Quantized: Mathematics Machine learning works spectacularly well, but mathematicians aren't quite sure why. At a dinner I attended some years ago, the distinguished differential geometer Eugenio Calabi volunteered to me his tongue-in-cheek distinction between pure and applied mathematicians. A pure mathematician, when stuck on the problem under study, often decides to narrow the problem further and so avoid the obstruction."
