description: 'Douglas Rushkoff emerged as a media commentator in 1994 with his first book, Cyberia. His debut examined "the early psychedelic, rave roots of digital technology. I was trying to infer what a digital society might be like given the beliefs of these people," he tells me, while speaking on phone from his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, some 20 miles north of Manhattan.'
