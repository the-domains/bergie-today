  Google is about to deal a small blow to some of the most annoying ads on
  mobile: pop-ups and interstitials. It's not a stretch to argue that readers
  don't like these ads. So Google is making a call that websites that use
  pop-ups and interstitials are worse search results and may rank them lower
  because of it.
