description: 'A good theory is an act of the informed imagination - it reaches toward the unknown while grounded in the firmest foundations of the known. In "Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs," the Harvard cosmologist Lisa Randall proposes that a thin disk of dark matter in the plane of the Milky Way triggered a minor perturbation in deep space that caused the major earthly catastrophe that decimated the dinosaurs.'
