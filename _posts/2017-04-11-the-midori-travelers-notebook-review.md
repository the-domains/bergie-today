  The Midori Traveler's Notebook is not for the feint of heart. Perhaps that
  takes things to the extreme. It's rare to find a tool that flies so directly
  in the face of all-encompassing digitalism and efficiency, especially one with
  such popularity. The Midori Traveler's Notebook is, by and large, a notebook.
