  More Google Chromebooks are sold in the US than Apple Macs, according to the
  latest figures from analyst firm IDC. While few think of the company, famous
  more for its mobile and internet software, as a major creator of PC operating
  systems, the slimmed-down Chrome OS has powered almost 2m laptops sold to
  Americans in the first quarter of 2016, IDC told the Verge.
