  One evening last November, a fifty-four-year-old woman from the Bronx arrived
  at the emergency room at Columbia University's medical center with a grinding
  headache. Her vision had become blurry, she told the E.R. doctors, and her
  left hand felt numb and weak. The doctors examined her and ordered a CT scan
  of her head.
