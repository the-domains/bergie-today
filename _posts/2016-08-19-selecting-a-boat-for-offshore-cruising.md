  Before starting the boat selection process, it is imperative to find out if
  you really like sailing and are comfortable living aboard. If you aren't yet
  an accomplished sailor, consider a live-aboard cruising instruction course
  such as Offshore Sailing School's Fast Track to Cruising. As many coastal
  sailors do not enjoy oceans passages complete an offshore passage to ensure
  you do. Time spent offshore will quickly clarify your priorities for boat
  selection and equipment plus generally satisfies the prerequisite for
  obtaining offshore insurance for your future boat.
