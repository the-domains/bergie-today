  On Monday the popular "Sarcastic Rover" Twitter account offered a succinct
  description for how difficult it is to launch a probe from Earth and place it
  safely on the surface of Mars: "Landing on Mars is like tossing a baseball
  from New York to Tokyo and having it drop into a can of soup. Also the can
  still has a lid on."
