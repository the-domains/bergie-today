description: 'n 1965, Gordon Moore, who later founded Intel Corporation, wrote an essay for Electronics Magazine. In it, he attempted to do the impossible - predict the future. He opined that the newly trendy technology of computer chips would become doubly powerful every two years at low cost, and they would eventually be so small, that they could be embedded in homes, cars and what he referred to as "personal portable communications equipment."'
