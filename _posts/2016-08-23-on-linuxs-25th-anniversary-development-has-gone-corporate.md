  The Linux operating system kernel is 25 years old this month. It was August
  25, 1991 when Linus Torvalds posted his famous message announcing the project,
  claiming that Linux was "just a hobby, won't be big and professional like
  gnu." But now, Linux is far bigger and more professional than Torvalds could
  have imagined.
