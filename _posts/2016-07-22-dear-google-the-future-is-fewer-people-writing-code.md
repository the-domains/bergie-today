  Google recently launched Project Bloks - a "platform" that will enable
  developers, educators and designers to work together in order to build
  "physical programming experiences" for children. This actually has the
  potential to be a great educational tool - but not in the way Google presents
  it (or at least not in the way it's being written about).

> The real benefit of something like Project Bloks is that it actually _removes the code; _it allows children to begin thinking programmatically, without the obstacle of syntax. And this is a tough distinction to make, because people often use "programming" and "coding" synonymously. But the fact of the matter is thinking programmatically needs to be divorced from writing code: the former offers large educational value to a broad range of students, while the latter offers very little.
