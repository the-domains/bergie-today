  A large part of the internet became inaccessible today after a botnet made up
  of IP cameras and digital video recorders was used to DoS a major DNS
  provider. This highlighted a bunch of things including how maybe having all
  your DNS handled by a single provider is not the best of plans, but in the
  long run there's no real amount of diversification that can fix this -
  malicious actors have control of a sufficiently large number of hosts that
  they could easily take out multiple providers simultaneously.
