  Microsoft calls it "conversation as a platform." Google says it wants to
  computers to have an "ongoing two-way dialogue" with their users. This both is
  and isn't a metaphor. Digital assistants that we talk to - Siri, Alexa,
  Cortana - are already commonplace, but creating computers that talk back will
  mean something extra: using machine learning to offer users prompts and
  suggestions.
