    description: "Your location has been collected and stored on Google's servers for a long time (if you allow Google to track you), but accessing that information in the past has difficult. Now, the Timeline feature will be front and center in Google Maps, letting you see everywhere you've visited -- ever."

    description: 'Yikes: Google is rolling out a new Maps feature for Android called Your Timeline -- if for no other reason than to showcase its all-seeing, all-knowing, data-gathering omnipotence. The feature -- providing an Android phone was along for the ride -- allows users to retrace past location data, correlated with other types of pertinent info gathered by Skynet during a journey.'
