  Less than a month before the end of the mission, Rosetta's high-resolution
  camera has revealed the Philae lander wedged into a dark crack on Comet
  67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The images were taken on 2 September by the OSIRIS
  narrow-angle camera as the orbiter came within 2.7 km of the surface and
  clearly show the main body of the lander, along with two of its three legs.
