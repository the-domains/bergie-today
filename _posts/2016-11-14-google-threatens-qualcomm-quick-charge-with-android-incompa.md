  The proliferation of USB Type-C is making charging various devices easier than
  ever. Smartphones (other than the iPhone) and laptops are unifying under a
  single charging port, allowing any charger to plug into anything else. Today
  you can plug your Type-C phone into your Type-C laptop charger, and charging
  will happen.
