  A few months ago I moved to a few acres in the country, and needed somewhere
  to work - so I built myself a solar powered off grid office out of a Tuff-Shed
  Pro Studio! On one side, I've built a great desk corner with plenty of power
  and more than enough AC to keep me cool when it's over 100F out.
