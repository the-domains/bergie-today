  People best understand computer programs in a different order than compilers
  do. This is a key idea of literate programming, and one that distinguishes
  literate programs from heavily commented programs. Traditional source code, no
  matter how heavily commented, is presented in the order dictated by the
  compiler. The computer is the primary audience.
