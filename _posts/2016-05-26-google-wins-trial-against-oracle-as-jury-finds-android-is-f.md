description: "Following a two-week trial, a jury has found that Google's Android operating system does not infringe Oracle-owned copyrights because its re-implementation of 37 Java APIs is protected by \"fair use.\" The verdict was reached after three days of deliberation. The verdict in Google's favor ends the trial, which began earlier this month."
