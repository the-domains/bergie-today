description: 'I just landed in my home office after a one day visit to Erlang User Conference 2015 (EUC2015). Not that it was a very long travel though, some 10 subway stations away at most, Munchenbryggeriet here in Stockholm :). The Erlang virtual machine, and what people do with it, is kind of fascinating.'
