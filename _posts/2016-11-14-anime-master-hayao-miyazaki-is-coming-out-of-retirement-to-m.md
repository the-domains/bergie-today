  Back in 2013, legendary Japanese animator and director Hayao Miyazaki
  announced he would be retiring; making no more feature-length films in order
  to concentrate on smaller projects. Well, it turns out you can’t keep a good
  Oscar-winning artist down, and Miyazaki says he’s now coming out of retirement
  to make one last movie.
