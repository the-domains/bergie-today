  I’m in the middle of a slow breakup with Apple. It has been painful but, to be
  honest, the split has been in the works for a few years now. Some people here
  know that I have been a bit of an Apple obsessive for the last decade plus. I
  have purchased just about every iPhone, iPad, iPod, iMac and iDontknowwhat.
  Apple Watch. Apple chargers. Apple Apps. Our house is littered with old Apple
  products, something that drives my wife Margo absolutely insane.
