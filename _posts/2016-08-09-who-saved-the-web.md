  We are drowning in dystopian visions of the Internet with attacks of privacy,
  free speech and personal security that were unthinkable only a decade ago.
  Someday, we will look back and ask: who saved the Web? And we will remember
  that it took a combination of enlightened educators, hackers and innovators,
  global activists, and determined policy makers to protect one of the most
  important and promising human creations of all time.
