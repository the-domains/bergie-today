  One of the worst effects of ant infestation doesn't happen inside your house
  or on your picnic blanket. It takes place in farms and gardens, where many
  species of ants tend to herds of aphids. These tiny insects are a bane to
  plants-aphids weaken plants by feeding on their sap, and they sometimes
  transmit deadly viruses while eating.
