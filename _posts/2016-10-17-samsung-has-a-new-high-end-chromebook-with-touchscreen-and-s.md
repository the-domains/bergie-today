  The new Chromebook comes with a variety of impressive features: a 12.3 inch
  2400x1600 resolution touch screen that can rotate 360 degrees, minimal bezels,
  32GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, a stylus, an all-metal 12.9 mm-thick body and 10
  hours of battery time. The hardware seems to be designed with Android app
  support in mind.
