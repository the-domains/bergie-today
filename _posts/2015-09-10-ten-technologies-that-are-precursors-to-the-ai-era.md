    description: "IBM's Jeopardy!-playing computer system, Watson, combined two separate areas of artificial intelligence research with winning results. Natural language understanding was merged with statistical analysis of vast, unstructured piles of text to find the likely answers to cryptic Jeopardy! clues. Now IBM aims to add another powerful AI technique, known as deep learning, to the commercial version of Watson."
