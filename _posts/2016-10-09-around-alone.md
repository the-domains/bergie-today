  On December 24, 1968, astronaut Bill Anders, lunar module pilot on the Apollo
  8 mission-his first and only space flight-took a photograph. In it, the
  distant blue earth, half in shadow, rises above the gray curve of the moon’s
  surface. Anders and the other crew members, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, were
  the first humans to orbit the moon. They were also the first to travel far
  away enough from our planet that they could look back and see it whole, a blue
  sphere against a void.
