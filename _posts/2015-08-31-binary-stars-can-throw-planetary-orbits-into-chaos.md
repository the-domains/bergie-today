description: "Planets go through a process known as precession, where the angle of their orbital tracks around a star changes over time. This is a very slow process, requiring many orbits to complete. The part that isn't generally covered in introductory astronomy courses is what happens to precession in binary star systems. For distant companions, the orbit is very long, and thus the change in gravitational influences is slow."
