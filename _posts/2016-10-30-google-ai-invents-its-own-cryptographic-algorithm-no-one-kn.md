  Google Brain has created two artificial intelligences that evolved their own
  cryptographic algorithm to protect their messages from a third AI, which was
  trying to evolve its own method to crack the AI-generated crypto. The study
  was a success: the first two AIs learnt how to communicate securely from
  scratch.
