  USB-C ports were supposed to bring universal charging, but the last time
  PCWorld dove into it, the results were pretty dismal. Google's
  second-generation Chromebook Pixel and Apple's original 12-inch MacBook had no
  issues working with each others' chargers, but HP, Dell, and Razer all gave us
  fits.
