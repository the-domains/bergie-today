description: "Earlier this month, the El Faro cargo ship mysteriously disappeared as it approached the Bahamas, where it collided with the 125-mph winds and 50-foot seas of Hurricane Joaquin. The US Coast Guard believes the ship sank after taking on water and seeing its engines fail, though a clearer picture likely won't emerge until authorities recover its voyage recorder."
