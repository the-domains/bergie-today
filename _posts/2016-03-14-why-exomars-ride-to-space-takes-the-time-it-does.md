description: 'On 14 March 2016 at 9:31:42 UTC, a Proton M / Breeze M rocket will lift off from Baikonur Cosmodrome with the ExoMars 2016 spacecraft under its payload fairing.  10 hours and 45 minutes later, the rocket will release its payload and ExoMars will be on an Earth escape trajectory - the ExoMars 2016 mission will have started.  But hey: ten hours and 45 minutes? Almost half a day? Why does it take so long this time? After all, with both the Mars Express and Venus Express missions the escape sequence was over within 90 minutes from liftoff.'
