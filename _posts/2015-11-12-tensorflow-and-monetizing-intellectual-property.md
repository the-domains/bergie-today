description: "Ten years ago Bill Gates suggested that open source software was the province of \"modern-day sort of communists\" whose views on intellectual property were hopelessly outdated: The idea that the United States has led in creating companies, creating jobs, because we've had the best intellectual property system - there's no doubt about that in my mind, and when people say they want to be the most competitive economy, they've got to have the incentive system."
