  The "page-based CMS" is not a bad thing. We try to pretend we don't need to
  think about pages anymore, but most of the time, attempts to liberate
  ourselves from the notion of a page is just impractical idealism. Furthermore,
  the page-based model doesn't really matter that much, in the big picture.
