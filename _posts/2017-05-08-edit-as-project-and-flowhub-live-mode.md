  In Flowhub you can create and edit full flow-based programming projects. The
  live mode enables introspecting running FBP systems. This weekend we rolled
  out Flowhub 0.19 which makes it easy to move between these modes. Flowhub's
  live mode is designed for making software introspectable - flow-based systems
  provide access to the graph and network state information, and tools like
  Flowhub then visualize it.
