  Imagine that the world as we know it ends tomorrow. There's a global
  catastrophe: a pandemic virus, an asteroid strike, or perhaps a nuclear
  holocaust. The vast majority of the human race perishes. Our civilisation
  collapses. The post-apocalyptic survivors find themselves in a devastated
  world of decaying, deserted cities and roving gangs of bandits looting and
  taking by force.
