<article style=""><h1>The billionaire’s typewriter</h1><p>A friend pointed me to a story on Medium called "Death to Type­writ­ers," by Medium de­signer Marcin Wichary. The story is about the in­flu­ence of the type­writer on dig­i­tal type­set­ting. It ref­er­ences my "ex­cel­lent list" of type­writer habits. Thank you for the com­pli­ment, Mr. Wichary.</p><img src="http://practicaltypography.com/images/selectric-ball.jpeg" /></article>

> Mr. Williams de­scribes Medium's key ben­e­fit as res­cu­ing writ­ers from the "ter­ri­ble dis­trac­tion" of for­mat­ting chores. But con­sider the cost. Though he's bait­ing the hook with de­sign, he's also ask­ing you, the writer, to let him con­trol how you of­fer your work to read­ers. Mean­ing, to get the full ben­e­fit of Medium's de­sign, you have to let your story live on Medium, send all your read­ers to Medium, have your work per­ma­nently en­tan­gled with other sto­ries on Medium, and so on---a sig­nif­i­cant concession.
