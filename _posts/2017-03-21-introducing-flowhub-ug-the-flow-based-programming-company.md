  We're pleased to announce that Flowhub - the product made possible by this
  Kickstarter project - has now its own company dedicated to supporting and
  improving the visual programming environment.


  Last fall we bought the Flowhub and other flow-based programming assets from
  The Grid, and now after some paperwork we're up and running as Flowhub UG, a
  company registered in Berlin, Germany.
