  Seven alien, Earth-sized worlds bask in the cool, red light of their parent
  star. The planetary menagerie exists around a star overlooked by other
  exoplanet hunters, although it is just 12 parsecs (39 light years) from Earth.
  Astronomers have found other seven-planet systems before, but this is the
  first to have so many Earth-sized worlds.
