<article style=""><h1>Storing data into plants</h1><p>Have you ever imagined storing a computer program, music or your party picture from early 20&amp;grave;s into a plant. Imagine resting in a near park, taking a leaf from a flower and listening to the Rolling Stones directly from it? This sort of "green" information hosting could become a reality.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/50f4510b3806bd58509b3f64c86bde41b84793a1.jpg" /></article>

> We have encoded a "Hello World" computer program into a DNA code, synthesized it and cloned this Code DNA into a plasmid vector to be further used for transforming _Nicotiana benthamiana_ plants. The encoded program was reconstructed from the resulting seedlings with 100% accuracy and the plant said "Hello World" on the screen.
