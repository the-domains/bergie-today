  As mentioned in my Working on Android post, I've been using a mechanical
  keyboard for a couple of years now. Now that I work on Flowhub from home, it
  was a good time to re-evaluate the whole work setup. As far as regular
  keyboards go, the MiniLa was nice, but I wanted something more compact and
  ergonomic.
