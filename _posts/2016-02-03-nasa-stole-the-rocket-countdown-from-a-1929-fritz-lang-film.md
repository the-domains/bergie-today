description: "On December 1, 2014, NASA retired a historic piece of equipment at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It wasn't a rocket, or even a deep space nine-iron -it was the original countdown clock, an analog display the size of a titan's wristwatch that stood across the river from the rocket launch site and stoically ticked off the seconds until blastoff."
