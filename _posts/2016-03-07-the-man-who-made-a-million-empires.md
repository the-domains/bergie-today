description: "Not many creators have the brazen audacity to slap their name in the actual titles of the things they create. John Lennon didn't call his 1971 album, \"John Lennon's Imagine.\" Mrs. Dalloway isn't called \"Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway.\" James Cameron has so far managed to keep his name out of all his movie titles.  But a lot of Sid Meier's games flash the words \"Sid Meier\" right there in the title. Most famously: the Sid Meier's Civilization series, which has sold more than 33 million units over the past 25 years."
