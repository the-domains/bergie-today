  Today, with a single tweet, the note-taking app Vesper has officially been
  shuttered. At its release, Vesper was widely promoted by the Apple indie
  developer communtiy as the hot new thing to try. More than anything else, it
  had an excellent pedigree, with influential blogger John Gruber of Daring
  Fireball at the helm. Many hopeful users switched to it for their primary
  note-taking needs, expecting that features like Mac support would arrive in
  short order. If any app from this circle was destined to be a breakaway hit,
  it was this one. And now, with barely a mention, it’s all but swept away,
  years after langishing with barely an update.
