  At a minimum, Pokemon Go makes walking the dog more interesting. This morning,
  Hazel and I caught Kakuna in my alley, Pidgey in front of the nearby
  comic-book store. I was told I don't have enough skill level yet to visit the
  Pokemon Gym, which is apparently where you go to test battle skills, and which
  is located at the town pool.
