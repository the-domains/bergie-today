  Over the past few years, everyone - investors, developers, consumers - have
  been looking for the next platform. 2017 is the ten year anniversary of the
  iPhone - nine years since it truly became a platform, with the launch of the
  App Store - and it is in no way an overstatement to say that it fundamentally
  altered the state of computing.
