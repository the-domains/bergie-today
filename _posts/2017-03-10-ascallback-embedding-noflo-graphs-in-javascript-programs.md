  It has always been easy to wrap existing JavaScript code into NoFlo graphs -
  just write a component that exposes its functionality via some ports. Going
  the other way and exposing a NoFlo graph to JS land was also possible but
  cumbersome. With NoFlo 0.8.3 we now made it super easy with the new asCallback
  API.
