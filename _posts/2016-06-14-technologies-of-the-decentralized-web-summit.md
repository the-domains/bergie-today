  The core vision of a decentralized web is a web that respects user privacy and
  user data, has funding models besides ads, that is self-archiving, and cannot
  be censored or taken down. All technology is political, and all technology
  reflects human values in its functionality. The possibility of a decentralized
  web is the possibility to build thoughtful technology around those values
  which can empower marginalized voices and bolster freedom of speech and
  expression
