    description: "Design in the chameleon-colored world of technology is still young. The word interaction design only started getting thrown around in the 90s. When I started my first job, before the advent of the iPhone, I remember our team compiling a list of all the folks we could find who had ever designed an interactive application before."

    description: "There are divergent things happening in the product and interaction design community. On one hand, we have some amazing pieces of writing from the likes of Ryan Singer and Julie Zhuo, moving our craft forward. On the other hand, we have a growing number of people posting and discussing their work on Dribbble, the aggregated results of which are moving our craft backwards."

    description: "I love design and startup and I firmly believe magical companies emerge when these two meet, e.g. Braun, Apple, Airbnb, Medium, YouTube, Square, and Nest. The critical mass of combined business, design and technical skills have made these companies incredibly successful. But I always feel people overcomplicate design with their multiple principles and frameworks."
