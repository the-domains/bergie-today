description: "When we design responsively, our content elegantly and efficiently flows into any device. All of our content, that is, except images. For years, we've catered to users with the highest-resolution screens by sending giant images to everyone. No longer. Eric Portis takes us through the new picture element and other attributes to let us mark up multiple, alternate sources."
