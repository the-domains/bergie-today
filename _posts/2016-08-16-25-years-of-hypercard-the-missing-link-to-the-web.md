  Sometime around 1988, my landlady and I cut a deal. She would purchase a
  Macintosh computer, I would buy an external hard drive, and we would leave the
  system in the living room to share. She used the device most, since I did my
  computing on an IBM 286 and just wanted to keep up with Apple developments.
