description: 'Since June 2015, collaborators from Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple and the W3C WebAssembly Community Group have been hard at work designing, specifying, and implementing  WebAssembly, a new runtime and compilation target for the web. WebAssembly is a low-level, portable bytecode that is designed to be encoded in a compact binary format and executed at near-native speed in a memory-safe sandbox. As an evolution of existing technologies, WebAssembly is tightly integrated with the web platform, as well as faster to download over the network and faster to instantiate than asm.js, a low-level subset of JavaScript.'

<article style=""><h1>Experimental support for WebAssembly in V8</h1><p>Since June 2015, collaborators from Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Apple and the W3C WebAssembly Community Group have been hard at work designing, specifying, and implementing  WebAssembly, a new runtime and compilation target for the web. WebAssembly is a low-level, portable bytecode that is designed to be encoded in a compact binary format and executed at near-native speed in a memory-safe sandbox. As an evolution of existing technologies, WebAssembly is tightly integrated with the web platform, as well as faster to download over the network and faster to instantiate than asm.js, a low-level subset of JavaScript.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1b934b057cb9c7fab0d3dab1ff2d4061c7ee0bb2.jpg" /></article>
