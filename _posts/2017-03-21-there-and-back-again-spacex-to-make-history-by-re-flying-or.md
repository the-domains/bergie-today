  We don't have an official launch date yet for SpaceX's historic rocket
  re-launch just yet, but it could come as soon as March 29th. During this
  flight, which will deliver the SES-10 satellite to geostationary orbit, the
  company plans to reuse the Falcon 9 first stage booster it successfully landed
  on a drone ship last April.
