<article style=""><h1>The Web's Cruft Problem</h1><p>In this article I’m going to argue that the reason for this hatred, and the biggest problem the web faces today is “cruft”: a term I mean to collectively refer to all the crap that the average web page includes that does not contribute towards what the user is actually trying to accomplish — read an article, buy a product, and so forth. I’ll also argue that the cruft problem is largely caused by a greater monetization problem that the web faces today.</p><img src="http://developer.telerik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/web-inspector.jpg" /></article>
