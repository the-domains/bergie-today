  Before I started using tmux, I’d hear it mentioned frequently. It always
  sounded cool, and while there’s no shortage of great information on the web
  about what tmux is, it was never entirely clear to me how it would
  dramatically improve my development workflow. After using tmux for a few
  years, I’ve come to rely on its ability to streamline several aspects of my
  development process. Thanks to tmux, my workflow is now more organized, more
  automated, and easier to customize. My hope is that by sharing a few concrete
  examples of how tmux has helped me, it may help others better understand what
  might be gained by taking tmux for a spin.
