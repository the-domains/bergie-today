  Dutch scientists said Thursday crops of four vegetables and cereals grown on
  soil similar to that on Mars have been found safe to eat, amid plans for the
  first manned mission to the planet. Abundant harvests of radishes, peas, rye
  and tomatoes all grown on the soil were found to contain "no dangerous levels"
  of heavy metals, said the team from Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
