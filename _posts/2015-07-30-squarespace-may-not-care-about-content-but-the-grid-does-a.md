> Squarespace may not care about content, but The Grid does. At least the technical characteristics of that content. It recognizes people and objects in your photos, the length of your copy, your tonal preferences, and eventually, the frequency of your bowel movements. How many of us consider these things when designing our systems? What does it mean for the web design industry when this machine does a better job of caring for content than most designers?
