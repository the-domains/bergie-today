  Elon Musk will present the world with SpaceX's plans for Mars colonization
  today in Guadalajara, Mexico - what should be the victorious presentation of a
  dream project. But he doesn’t have the money to get to Mars alone. So today he
  must either announce a substantial financial partner or woo one, in the face
  of a very recent SpaceX rocket explosion.
