    description: "I somehow didn't hear anything about the comet C/2014 Q1 (Pan-STARRS), which isn't to surprising: It never got bright to Northern Hemisphere observers. The comet's orbit kept it mostly in the Southern Hemisphere's skies, and it only recently got brighter once it swept past the Sun in its orbit."
