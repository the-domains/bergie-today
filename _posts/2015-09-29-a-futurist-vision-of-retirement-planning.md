description: "Retirement planning in your 20s and 30s, when we're told to begin, is generally regarded as sober and responsible dues paying, the province of stoic bean counters. Not planning for retirement-not taking advantage of the magic of compound interest to bathe our last decades in a golden glow, perhaps in a dream house in Tuscany-is a sign of immaturity, and probably other distressing character traits like leaving your dishes in the sink overnight."

    description: "Kurzweil argues that you have interlocked curves, so even after silicon tops out there's going to be something else. Maybe he's right, but right now that's not what's going on, so it unwinds a lot of the arguments about the future of computing and the impact of computing on society."

<article style=""><h1>A Futurist Vision of Retirement Planning</h1><p>But the future is a place we’re going to live, if we make it that far, and for those of us who like to minimize our financial risks (or get maximum utility from our financial options, because we aren’t frightened people with storm bunkers, no—we are crusading adventurers, protagonists who protag), here are some of the things that those of us who try to predict the future think are most likely to impact your retirement.</p><img src="http://thebillfold.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/09/blade_runner2-noscale.jpg" /></article>
