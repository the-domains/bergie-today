  One important part of working with a web designer — whether AI or human — is
  to be able to try different designs of your site and be able to give feedback
  on them. With The Grid, this works by giving your friendly AI designer Molly

  aspects of them.

  Today we rolled out a feature that makes these redesigns smarter.
