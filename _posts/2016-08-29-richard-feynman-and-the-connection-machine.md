  Feynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the
  Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the
  subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is
  a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard
  made to the mainstream of computer science.
