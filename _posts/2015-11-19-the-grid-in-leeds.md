# The Grid in Leeds

This month's [The Grid meetup][0] takes us to Leeds, northern England. Grey skies, great beer, and occasionally spotty WiFi.

The aim is to work on the feedback we've received from the thousands of founding members we've activated since early October.

Having recently completed my [German sailing license][1], one aspect of interest was obviously the big number of narrowboats along the channels inside the city.

Here are couple of views from the daily commute:

A narrowboat is certainly something I could see myself living in eventually.
