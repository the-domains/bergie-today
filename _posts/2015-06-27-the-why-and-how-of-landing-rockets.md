description: 'Some of you may have been following our recent attempts to vertically land the first stage of our Falcon 9 rocket back on Earth. There was this attempt in January, followed by this one in April. These landing attempts move us toward our goal of producing a fully and rapidly reusable rocket system, which will dramatically reduce the cost of space transport.'
