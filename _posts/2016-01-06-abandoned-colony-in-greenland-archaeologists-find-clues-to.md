description: 'On Sept. 14, 1408, Thorstein Olafsson and Sigrid Björnsdottir were married. The ceremony took place in a church on Hvalsey Fjord in Greenland that was only five meters (about 16 feet) tall. It must have been difficult for the bride and groom to recognize each other in the dim light of the church.'
