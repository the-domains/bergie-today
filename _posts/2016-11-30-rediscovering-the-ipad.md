  It started with two unpleasant feelings: It’s not reliable anymore, and It
  needs too much babysitting. Harsh, but also fair. My beloved 2015 MacBook 12”,
  along with its complimentary 2016-model replacement, has been the source of
  conflicting emotions over the past year. A series of breakdowns on the
  controversy-stirring new keyboard, with week-long service times on each
  occasion. After more than two months, the 2016 replacement is behaving just
  fine, but still. My confidence in the machine has been damaged.
