  As developers, we tend to believe there is a perfect solution for every
  problem and that can drive us to make wrong conclusions In psychology there is
  a concept called Absolute Thinking. It represents a common tendency to think
  in "black and white" terms. It happens when someone provides two alternatives
  to a problem that doesn't have just two alternatives.
