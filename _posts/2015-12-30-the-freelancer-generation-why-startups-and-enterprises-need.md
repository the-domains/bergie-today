    description: "The Freelancers Union estimates that 34% of the US workforce is already freelancing. That's 53 million Americans and by 2020 it's predicted to rise to 40%.

description: Gone are the days of the 40-hour work week that kept us at work eight hours a day (I find that most startup founders or business owners in Silicon Valley work 50-60 hours a week). Freelancing is becoming the accepted norm of the startup world.
