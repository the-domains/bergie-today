    description: "In January, the British-American computer scientist Stuart Russell drafted and became the first signatory of an open letter calling for researchers to look beyond the goal of merely making artificial intelligence more powerful. \"We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial,\" the letter states."

    description: "About 18% of experts working in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) believe that AI will one day pose an 'existential threat' to humanity, according to a report from Oxford University. The possibility that AI might be our ultimate undoing has been a hot topic of late, with doom-laden remarks from people like Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking widely reported."

    description: "Futurist Ray Kurzweil has made headlines with his provocative yet often accurate predictions, like that a computer would beat a human in chess ( already happened) or that self-driving cars would take us everywhere ( starting to happen). But, to paraphrase fellow futurist Peter Diamandis, Kurzweil's brilliance isn't in the predictions themselves."

    description: "Computers will have developed \"common sense\" within a decade and we could be counting them among our friends not long afterwards, one of the world's leading AI scientists has predicted. Professor Geoff Hinton, who was hired by Google two years ago to help develop intelligent operating systems, said that the company is on the brink of developing algorithms with the capacity for logic, natural conversation and even flirtation."

description: "Andrew Ng builds artificial intelligence systems for a living. He taught AI at Stanford, built AI at Google, and then moved to the Chinese search engine giant, Baidu, to continue his work at the forefront of applying artificial intelligence to real-world problems. So when he hears people like Elon Musk or Stephen Hawking-people who are not intimately familiar with today's technologies-talking about the wild potential for artificial intelligence to, say, wipe out the human race, you can practically hear him facepalming."
