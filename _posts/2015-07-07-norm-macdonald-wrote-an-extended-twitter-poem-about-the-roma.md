description: "Saturday Night Live-alum Norm Macdonald's Twitter is perhaps best known for beautifully dead-pan award show reactions and extremely dry live coverage of sporting events, but a recent existential crisis seems to have jump-started a change of pace. Norm expresses disdain for poetry, then continues to create a gorgeous Hemingway-style work of morosity."
