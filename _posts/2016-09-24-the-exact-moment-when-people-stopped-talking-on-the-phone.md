  When Slate was founded in 1996, people all over the world spent much of their
  day speaking into telephones. In 2016, as celebrates its 20th birthday, the
  phone call is a thing of the past. Not entirely of the past, of course; phone
  conversation lives on in roughly the same way that swing dancing lives on, or
  Latin declension, or manual transmission.
