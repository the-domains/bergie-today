  My partner and I step through a portal and into a bright, vaguely Mayan
  temple. I pick up a torch to light the way, and we set off on our adventure:
  over the course of less than ten minutes, we find a hidden passage, escape
  from a huge serpent in an underground lake, climb hundreds of feet to a
  beautiful vista, and, after getting through a cramped hall full of spiders,
  fulfill a mystical prophecy about a fractured star.
