  I am the zen minimalist monk. The gods of capitalism look upon my few
  possessions and weep. There's a place for everything, and everything's in its
  place. Crucially; there's no room for anything else. I've won. The neoliberal
  hegemony has lost. Hah! ...oh but I would love to upgrade my headphone amp.
