description: "The large, bright spot on Ceres can be seen in the most detailed images yet taken from NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which has been orbiting the dwarf planet for a year. The pictures, taken just 240 miles (385 kilometers) above the surface, show that the region known as Occator Crater is comprised of a complex mixture of land formations, deepening the mystery of how the area formed."
