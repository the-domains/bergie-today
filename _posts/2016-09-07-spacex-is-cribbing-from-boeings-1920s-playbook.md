  On March 3, 1919, William Boeing and Edward Hubbard took off in a seaplane
  from the harbor of Vancouver, British Columbia. They flew 142 miles south to
  Seattle, where Boeing-a businessman who had previously started a profitable
  lumber company in Michigan-would soon make a name for himself as one of
  America's most successful entrepreneurs of the 20th century.
