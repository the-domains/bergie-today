  The passengers and crew of Malaysia Airlines Flight 124 were just settling
  into their five-hour flight from Perth to Kuala Lumpur that late on the
  afternoon of 1 August 2005. Approximately 18 minutes into the flight, as the
  Boeing 777-200 series aircraft was climbing through 36 000 feet altitude on
  autopilot, the aircraft-suddenly and without warning-pitched to 18 degrees,
  nose up, and started to climb rapidly.
