> If you don't know anything about mechanics, you can't survive in this world. If you don't know anything about how a computer works or code works, as a communicator, which is what a designer is --- the interface between machines and man, that's what we are. We are the interface, we interpret what the machine says into visible language. If you don't understand how the machine works, you're going to be laughed out of the room by the engineering guys, because you can't communicate with them.
