  The other day, I found myself in an intense conversation about the potential
  of shared virtual reality with a senior engineer at one of the largest tech
  companies in Silicon Valley. I say a "conversation," but if I were to be more
  frank, I would have to admit that for long stretches I was on the receiving
  end of a rant.
