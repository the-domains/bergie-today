  Microsoft is bringing a full version of Windows 10, complete with desktop app
  support, to ARM chipsets. The software giant demonstrated Windows 10 running
  on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip today, complete with HD video playback,
  Adobe Photoshop support, and Microsoft Office. Microsoft expects ARM-based
  laptops to be the first to adopt this new version of Windows 10. Traditional
  x86 desktop apps will be emulated, making the experience seamless to the end
  user. Laptops might be the first, but it’s easy to see past that and realize
  that this means Microsoft is about to turn a phone into a real PC.
