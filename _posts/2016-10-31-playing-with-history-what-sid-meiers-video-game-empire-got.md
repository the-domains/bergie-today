  The pleasure of Sid Meier’s Civilization series is that it is at once
  tantalizingly grand and endearingly granular. The game’s approach to the past
  has always been playful. Abe Lincoln can lead war-bands against Mahatma
  Gandhi’s phalanxes. The Aztecs can build the first nuclear bomb. Every version
  of the game begins with the same wide-open promise: a settler, a worker, a few
  tiles of visible land, and an ocean of darkness—all the ingredients of a world
  ready to be discovered and made anew.
