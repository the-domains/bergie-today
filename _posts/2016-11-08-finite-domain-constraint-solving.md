  "Alice, Bob, and Creo are splitting up candy. Alice is oldest so she should
  get the more than the others. Bob doesn't like to have 5 candies. Creo wants
  to have at least as much as Bob. There are 20 candies to divide, how do you
  split them?" This would be a classic example of a finite domain constraint
  problem
