  In the ancient Mesopotamian city of Uruk, residents enjoyed many benefits of
  modern life. The city, located in modern-day Iraq, was home to massive
  ziggurats that would rival any of today's modern skyscrapers for sheer
  monumentality. People in Uruk exchanged goods for money, played board games,
  and sent each other letters on clay tablets using a writing system called
  cuneiform.
