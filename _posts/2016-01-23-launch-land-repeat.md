    description: "Lands' End was long considered one of the crown jewels of the Sears Holdings empire, a beloved brand renowned for its sturdy, sensible apparel. But the dusty label has been dragged down in recent years by Sears' ongoing dramatic sales declines, chronic inability to get shoppers to come into its stores, and wholesale store closings, not to mention an integration since its 2002 acquisition by Sears that never really took hold."

description: 'The very same booster that flew above the Karman line and then landed vertically at its launch site last November has now flown and landed again, demonstrating reuse. This time, New Shepard reached an apogee of 333,582 feet (101.7 kilometers) before both capsule and booster gently returned to Earth for recovery and reuse.'
