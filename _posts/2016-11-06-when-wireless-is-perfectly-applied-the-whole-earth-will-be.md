  “When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a
  huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and
  rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly,
  irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony
  we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face,
  despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments
  through which we shall be able to do his will be amazingly simple compared
  with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest
  pocket.”
