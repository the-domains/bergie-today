description: 'The Lockheed Constellation was a lovely thing. TWA got the first one in late 1945, and started transatlantic service in 1946. It was the first pressurised airliner in widespread use, and Lockheed sold over 800 of them. It was also pretty much the last great propeller-powered airliner, because the future was jets.'
