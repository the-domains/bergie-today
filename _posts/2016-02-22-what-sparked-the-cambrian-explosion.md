description: 'A series of dark, craggy pinnacles rises 80 metres above the grassy plains of Namibia. The peaks call to mind something ancient - the burial mounds of past civilizations or the tips of vast pyramids buried by the ages. The stone formations are indeed monuments of a faded empire, but not from anything hewn by human hands.'
