  The Saildrone's carbon fiber sail acts like an aircraft wing. When air passes
  over it, thrust is created. The sail is stabilized by a counterweight that is
  placed in front of it and a tab trailing behind it that can automatically make
  small corrections to make sure it maintains an efficient angle to the wind.
