  An Amazon warehouse is a flurry of activity. Workers jog around a manmade
  cavern plopping items into yellow and black crates. Towering hydraulic arms
  lift heavy boxes toward the rafters. And an army of stubby orange robots slide

  consumer gratification ranging from bestsellers to kitchenware.
