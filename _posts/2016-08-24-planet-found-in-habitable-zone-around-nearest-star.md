  Astronomers using ESO telescopes and other facilities have found clear
  evidence of a planet orbiting the closest star to Earth, Proxima Centauri. The
  long-sought world, designated Proxima b, orbits its cool red parent star every
  11 days and has a temperature suitable for liquid water to exist on its
