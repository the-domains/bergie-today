            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Curse of Culture</h1><p>One of the seminal books on culture is Edgar Schein's Organizational Culture and Leadership. Schein writes in the introduction: Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of culture as a concept is that it points us to phenomena that are below the surface, that are powerful in their impact but invisible and to a considerable degree unconscious.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c76fb26828581ba867c0c8bee582dc1444accf91.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Programmers are not different, they need simple UIs. -</h1><p>I’m spending days trying to get a couple of APIs right. New APIs about modules, and a new Redis data type. I really mean it when I say *days*, just for the API.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Hyperloop the future of travel?</h1><p>There was a moment, an hour before an event last week, when 30 or so young fresh-faced people stood around their creation and posed for a group photo. They were in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. All around them, reminders of historic innovations that began with research at this legendary college.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fceb3f634fd2d10bc96a4691e18ea86eccce0898.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Come and Twiddle Tek Gear's one handed keyboard</h1><p>Over the years a plethora of keyboard alternatives have crossed the El Reg hardware desk, but none has had the utility, or longevity, of the Handykey Twiddler. This third incarnation has been a decade in the making, and arrived a year late, but with small hands and a willingness to learn it could make wearable computing practical.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/de878ab9a8d5ab068f99f528a2278789adf9e8db.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Google's Allo messaging app is a big step backwards</h1><p>A year ago, when Google began to unwind Google+, it felt like a positive sign for the company's underperforming social efforts. After sinking years into building a product overstuffed with photos, communication tools, link-sharing, and discussions, Google began to shrink them into more manageable tools. The results were largely positive.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/10834985271fad04b54dbfb96c11124ef92ad153.jpg"></article>]]></description>
