            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Teaching tomorrow</h1><p>"Because of the increased efficiency of machines, it is getting harder and harder for a human to make a productive contribution to society," says Sebastian Thrun. This is what you might expect to hear from the man who suggested Google's controversial Street View project to photograph the world's roadsides, who developed the company's eerie self-driving cars and who founded the secretive Google "skunk-works" project responsible for Glass, a wearable computer that resembles spectacles.</p><img src="http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20150905_TQD005_0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't Worry, Smart Machines Will Take Us With Them</h1><p>When it comes to artificial intelligence, we may all be suffering from the fallacy of availability: thinking that creating intelligence is much easier than it is, because we see examples all around us. In a recent poll, machine intelligence experts predicted that computers would gain human-level ability around the year 2050, and superhuman ability less than 30 years after.</p><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7061_6495cf7ca745a9443508b86951b8e33a.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Grand illusions</h1><p>Your correspondent stands, in a pleasingly impossible way, in orbit. The Earth is spread out beneath. A turn of the head reveals the blackness of deep space behind and above. In front is a table full of toys and brightly coloured building blocks, all of which are resolutely refusing to float away-for, despite his being in orbit, gravity's pull does not seem to have vanished.</p><img src="http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20150829_STD001_0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Binary stars can throw planetary orbits into chaos</h1><p>Planets go through a process known as precession, where the angle of their orbital tracks around a star changes over time. This is a very slow process, requiring many orbits to complete. The part that isn't generally covered in introductory astronomy courses is what happens to precession in binary star systems. For distant companions, the orbit is very long, and thus the change in gravitational influences is slow.</p><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fall_colors_3-640x360.jpg"></article>]]></description>

In this exclusive interview, he tells why. From the storyteller on a Greek stage to the latest in curved-screen tvs and IMAX theaters, the holy grail of entertainment has always been immersion: putting the audience "inside" the drama, transporting them to another time and place.</p><img src="http://assets.dmagazine.com/media/4/john_carmack_2.jpg"></article>]]></description>
