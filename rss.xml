            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Future of the Web Is 100 Years Old</h1><p>The Earth may not be flat, but the web certainly is. "There is no 'top' to the World-Wide Web," declared a 1992 foundational document from the World Wide Web Consortium-meaning that there is no central server or organizational authority to determine what does or does not get published.</p><img src="http://static.nautil.us/5322_a4a8a31750a23de2da88ef6a491dfd5c.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sailing across the Atlantic</h1><p>I had sailed on Helena once before, on a weekend trip in the Turku archipelago. But crossing the Atlantic would be a more interesting adventure. For a month this two-masted tall ship would be our home on the ocean.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/128058d2-2942-47d7-b397-5093b7f220ea.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Most Citizens of the Star Wars Galaxy are Probably Totally Illiterate</h1><p>Not once in any movie does someone pick up a book or newspaper, magazine, literary journal, or chapbook handmade by an aspiring Jawa poet. If something is read by someone in , it's almost certainly off of a screen (and even then, maybe being translated by a droid), and it's definitely not for entertainment purposes.</p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watto1.jpg?fit=475%2C%209999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C220px"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Space Doctor's Big Idea</h1><p>There once was a doctor with cool white hair. He was well known because he came up with some important ideas. He didn't grow the cool hair until after he was done figuring that stuff out, but by the time everyone realized how good his ideas were, he had grown the hair, so that's how everyone pictures him.</p><img src="http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Munroe-space-doctor-1200x630-1447782889.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Should We Talk to AIs?</h1><p>Not many years ago, the idea of having a computer broadly answer questions asked in plain English seemed like science fiction. But when we released Wolfram|Alpha in 2009 one of the big surprises (not least to me!) was that we'd managed to make this actually work.</p><img src="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/data/uploads/2015/11/information-transfer-billion-year-view.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Muji, the Japanese emporium of minimalist housewares, now makes houses, too</h1><p>If you shop at Muji, the Japanese emporium of minimalist, space-saving housewares, it's probably to pick up one of its excellent water-shedding umbrellas, or maybe a few of its adorably slender travel toothbrushes. Typically, you wouldn't buy anything that couldn't fit in your backpack.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hut_03-1200x630-e1447447726212.jpg"></article>]]></description>
