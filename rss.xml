            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Basic Income</h1><p>We're going to try something new-our first Request For Research. We'd like to fund a study on basic income-i.e., giving people enough money to live on with no strings attached. I've been intrigued by the idea for a while, and although there's been a lot of discussion, there's fairly little data about how it would work.</p></article>]]></description>

That's one heaping teaspoon of life-time, but you know what? It doesn't feel like it.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Dream Chaser DNA: A story of spaceplane evolution</h1><p>Since the earliest days of the space age there has been something inherently attractive in the idea of a spacecraft that could glide back after its mission and land like an aeroplane. From Sanger's Silbervogel onwards, a succession of spaceplanes sporting various shapes and configurations have flowed from the minds of aerospace designers.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ba001e648eb076ae6688cd9e2ab7777942dc8b8e.png"></article>]]></description>
