            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google Turning Its Lucrative Web Search Over to AI Machines</h1><p>When Google-parent Alphabet Inc. reported eye-popping earnings last week its executives couldn't stop talking up the company's investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. For any other company that would be a wonky distraction from its core business. At Google, the two are intertwined.</p><img src="http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i.ilGX8_US7U/v1/-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Some Finnish Engineers Would Like You To Put This Tiny Square Computer In Your Pocket</h1><p>Solu is a coaster-sized cloud-based portable computer that fits in your pocket. A team of Finnish engineers behind the device hope Solu will change the way we think of using our digital operating systems. Sure, we already have our portable computing devices such as iPads and smartphones, but Solu founder Kristoffer Lawson wants us to stop lugging all our heavy laptops and notebooks around and jump into the cloud-based era of "computer-as-a-service."</p><img src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/solu-social-e1445545933118.png?w=678&h=335"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The coming era of unlimited - and free - clean energy</h1><p>In the 1980s, leading consultants were skeptical about cellular phones. McKinsey & Company noted that the handsets were heavy, batteries didn't last long, coverage was patchy, and the cost per minute was exorbitant. It predicted that in 20 years the total market size would be about 900,000 units, and advised AT&T to pull out.</p><img src="http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-09-11/Bloomberg/201690075.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Theoretical Motivations for Deep Learning</h1><p>This post is based on the lecture "Deep Learning: Theoretical Motivations" given by Dr. Yoshua Bengio at Deep Learning Summer School, Montreal 2015. I highly recommend the lecture for a deeper understanding of the topic. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning algorithms based on learning multiple levels of representation.</p><img src="http://rinuboney.github.io/img/distributed_partition.png"></article>]]></description>
