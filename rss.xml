            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Planet Found in Habitable Zone Around Nearest Star</h1><p>Astronomers using ESO telescopes and other facilities have found clear evidence of a planet orbiting the closest star to Earth, Proxima Centauri. The long-sought world, designated Proxima b, orbits its cool red parent star every 11 days and has a temperature suitable for liquid water to exist on its surface.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fce37f84771cd14506a1aa1adfab61a7/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.eso.org%2Fimages%2Fscreen%2Feso1629a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google will punish sites that use annoying pop-up ads</h1><p>Google is about to deal a small blow to some of the most annoying ads on mobile: pop-ups and interstitials. It's not a stretch to argue that readers don't like these ads. So Google is making a call that websites that use pop-ups and interstitials are worse search results and may rank them lower because of it.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8c3bc805b695e183748711526ea2b820/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FGqBBlq4t1x05Yn-oSAtwxHEwO5Y%3D%2F21x0%3A1379x764%2F1600x900%2Fcdn0.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_image%2Fimage%2F50497191%2Fg.0.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Chromebooks outsell Macs for the first time</h1><p>More Google Chromebooks are sold in the US than Apple Macs, according to the latest figures from analyst firm IDC. While few think of the company, famous more for its mobile and internet software, as a major creator of PC operating systems, the slimmed-down Chrome OS has powered almost 2m laptops sold to Americans in the first quarter of 2016, IDC told the Verge.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1660320910404e258adc652e75e4aff4/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fmedia%2F80e786d113fefe9f095731334846dda2acfccab7%2F0_191_4368_2621%2F4368.jpg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3D6dc7a2e43035d41f87e55502b9700b4d"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Indie App Reliance]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Indie App Reliance</h1><p>Today, with a single tweet, the note-taking app Vesper has officially been shuttered. At its release, Vesper was widely promoted by the Apple indie developer communtiy as the hot new thing to try. More than anything else, it had an excellent pedigree, with influential blogger John Gruber of Daring Fireball at the helm. Many hopeful users switched to it for their primary note-taking needs, expecting that features like Mac support would arrive in short order. If any app from this circle was destined to be a breakaway hit, it was this one. And now, with barely a mention, itâ€™s all but swept away, years after langishing with barely an update.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Minimalism vs Upgradeism</h1><p>I am the zen minimalist monk. The gods of capitalism look upon my few possessions and weep. There's a place for everything, and everything's in its place. Crucially; there's no room for anything else. I've won. The neoliberal hegemony has lost.

It was August 25, 1991 when Linus Torvalds posted his famous message announcing the project, claiming that Linux was "just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu." But now, Linux is far bigger and more professional than Torvalds could have imagined.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6e262ecd4dba37b7e3efe42898f53b1a/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Flinus-torvalds-800x455.jpg"></article>]]></description>

To me, the most interesting part of Apple's recent press blitz was how in sync everyone was about one point in particular: that the company is unlikely to find another iPhone. Both Tim Cook and Eddy Cue stated this pretty directly in their respective interviews.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e33e7e8c724fb978a44ca5baa861ca24/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1200%2F1*00wuadtJ4eQCCVvVXZzMVw.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
