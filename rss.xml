            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bitcoin's Creator Satoshi Nakamoto is Probably This Unknown Australian Genius</h1><p>Even as his face towered 10 feet above the crowd at the Bitcoin Investor's Conference in Las Vegas, Craig Steven Wright was, to most of the audience of crypto and finance geeks, a nobody. The 44-year-old Australian, Skyping into the D Hotel ballroom's screen, wore the bitcoin enthusiast's equivalent of camouflage: a black blazer and a tieless, rumpled shirt, his brown hair neatly parted.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/78a6e9022f87c095e50883de54d3d9eefb5f842b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Google is the latest company to try to rethink how we interact with computers, designing and manufacturing a tablet and keyboard combination itself for the very first time instead of leaning on a partner to do it.</p><img src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2yOKKviul99iyA0sE3-X52Mz0bY=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4334077/Google-Pixel_C-review-6.0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New US space mining law to spark interplanetary gold rush</h1><p>Flashing some interplanetary gold bling and sipping "space water" might sound far-fetched, but both could soon be reality, thanks to a new US law that legalizes cosmic mining. In a first, President Barack Obama signed legislation at the end of November that allows commercial extraction of minerals and other materials, including water, from asteroids and the moon.</p><img src="http://cdn.phys.org/newman/gfx/news/2015/3-illustration.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Solar Power Could Slay the Fossil Fuel Empire by 2030</h1><p>​ In just 15 years, the world as we know it will have transformed forever. The ​age of oil, gas, coal and nuclear will be over. A new age of clean power and smarter cars will fundamentally, totally, and permanently disrupt the existing fossil fuel-dependent industrial infrastructure in a way that even the most starry-eyed proponents of 'green energy' could never have imagined.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/58a8b11d5edf757543d4397a559da2f1e154712a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Stonehenge may have been first erected in Wales, evidence suggests</h1><p>Evidence of quarrying for Stonehenge's bluestones is among the dramatic discoveries leading archaeologists to theorise that England's greatest prehistoric monument may have first been erected in Wales. It has long been known that the bluestones that form Stonehenge's inner horseshoe came from the Preseli hills in Pembrokeshire, around 140 miles from Salisbury Plain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/739e6cae9052cda56806f5a412efc9345ce9af6b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
