            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why video games are essential for inventing artificial intelligence</h1><p>The most important thing for humanity to do right now is to invent true artificial intelligence (AI): machines or software that can think and act independently in a wide variety of situations. Once we have artificial intelligence, it can help us solve all manner of other problems. Luckily, thousands of researchers around work on inventing artificial intelligence.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/12a9365425908b076d7513459d14f3e00029c3e3.jpg"></article>]]></description>
