            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why the Golden Age of Walking Robots Never Arrived</h1><p>Last year, the Pentagon held an international contest called the DARPA Robotics Challenge (or DRC), where more than 20 robots were tasked with navigating and interacting with a mock disaster site. They had to drive a quad down a dirt road, open a door, turn a valve or two, saw a hole in drywall, and shove their way through or over rubble to the exit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c9b7d1fa10c27b54990cfbb5a1dd7ff3c694a67f.gif"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Smartwatches and the three-second rule</h1><p>Smartwatches are still in their PDA phase. That seems like a pretty obvious conclusion when you give the category of wearables even a moment's thought. Personal Digital Assistants like the Palm Pilot or Pocket PCs or even Apple's Newton were usually not very useful unless you regularly synced them with your "real" computer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0ea395c98fe9228bb92a673e3bd26d0906936db8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The confrontation can't be found in any history books-the written word didn't become common in these parts for another 2000 years-but this was no skirmish between local clans.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0c43ae11986d5ee2094ded6653c1149f2ef9395e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Twitter taught Microsoft's AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day</h1><p>It took less than 24 hours for Twitter to corrupt an innocent AI chatbot. Yesterday, Microsoft unveiled Tay - a Twitter bot that the company described as an experiment in "conversational understanding." The more you chat with Tay, said Microsoft, the smarter it gets, learning to engage people through "casual and playful conversation."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/67925df2dc7a3e8726e0ec2848f02d820f602eb4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The pictures, taken just 240 miles (385 kilometers) above the surface, show that the region known as Occator Crater is comprised of a complex mixture of land formations, deepening the mystery of how the area formed.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9b5702a3cf4627abef8649e51a8fa2af63bd282c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
