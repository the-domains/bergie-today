The author of several books on global strategy, Khanna argues that (some) cities, as islands of good governance in an increasingly unstable world, will become the cornerstone of a new world order.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c01f73d8c0af01e0c637c7db9d2d7e200ff11b45.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Four pitfalls of hill climbing</h1><p>One of the great developments in product design has been the adoption of A/B testing. Instead of just guessing what is best for your customers, you can offer a product variant to a subset of customers and measure how well it works.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The New Web Typography</h1><p>We can trace a nervous path through the links and hearts that occupy our timelines. In search of answers, we’ve peeked under the covers of Material Design and examined hundreds of pattern libraries, since one of them might be secretly withholding the principles of good design within. But why are we obsessed with typographic rules? And if we were to make guidelines for setting text on the web, what form should those rules take?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/374b7f9883b87e902eda2f9953e3e832f33a2b83.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Testing, Testing - One, Two, Hands Free</h1><p>We wanted to explore what the future of mobile payments could look like. Imagine if you could rush through a drive-thru without reaching for your wallet, or pick up a hot dog at the ballpark without fumbling to pass coins or your credit card to the cashier. This prompted us to build a pilot app called Hands Free that we’re now in the early stages of testing. It lets you pay in stores quickly, easily, and completely hands-free.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bb48c1629224306294adb349378001b617100c95.png"></article>]]></description>
