Called the BEAM, short for Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, the room is launching on top of one of SpaceX's rockets on Friday; it will then be attached to the ISS sometime within the next four months.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c3da40165be69ef88f16c19e0faeff1240127727.gif"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Personal observations on the reliability of the Shuttle</h1><p>It appears that there are enormous differences of opinion as to the probability of a failure with loss of vehicle and of human life. The estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from management. What are the causes and consequences of this lack of agreement? Since 1 part in 100,000 would imply that one could put a Shuttle up each day for 300 years expecting to lose only one, we could properly ask "What is the cause of management's fantastic faith in the machinery?"</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5fa837f02df3763b1f34fd2758d38b66502dd6d7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework</h1><p>By "augmenting human intellect" we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by "complex situations" we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers--whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human "feel for a situation" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/34290f04e983355224cd1b0687d3af77608f237c.gif"></article>]]></description>
