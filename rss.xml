            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How evolution took us from Neolithic farmers to modern Europeans</h1><p>The Neolithic Revolution involved the advent of agriculture, which finally allowed people to settle down in ever-larger groups and focus on things other than procuring calories-things like developing written language and forming social cliques. It was one of the most profound events in the collective history of humanity.</p><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/neolithic-640x418.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Turning Glue Code into Graphs with CocoaFlow</h1><p>Application developers today have a tremendous amount of software at there disposal. Whether it's that great networking library, JSON parsing framework, or an in-house project, the ability to delegate so much logic to tried- and-tested solutions allows for an improved software development process and results in better apps.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What can a technologist do about climate change? A personal view.</h1><p>I'm also only going to directly discuss technology related to the primary cause of climate change (the burning of fossil fuels), although there are technological needs related to other causes ( livestock, deforestation, global poverty), as well as mitigating symptoms of climate change ( droughts and storms, ecosystem damage, mass migrations).</p><img src="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/Images/00-page-header.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Minimalism</h1><p>This is everything I own: A MacBook Pro, an iPad, an unlocked iPhone, seven shirts, two pairs of jeans, two jackets, one coat, one sweater, two pairs of shoes, a suitcase, a backpack, some gym shorts, bathroom stuff, socks and underwear. That’s it. Everything I own can be easily packed into a small suitcase and moved within 30 minutes. There is nothing that I want that I don’t already own. And this is despite owning a six-figure internet business.</p><img src="http://markmanson.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/minimalism2.jpg"></article>]]></description>
