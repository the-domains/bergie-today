            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Suntory Plans Space-Aged Whisky</h1><p>Not content with having the best whisky in the world, Suntory Holdings Ltd. plans to take its whisky out of this world and into space. The Japanese brewing and distilling company said this week it would send a total of six samples of its whiskies and other alcoholic beverages to the International Space Station, where they will be kept for at least a year to study the effect zero gravity has on aging.</p><img src="http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JQ714_jsunto_P_20150731025238.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Renewables briefly covered 78 percent of German electricity</h1><p>On July 25, Germany surpassed the old record of 74 percent renewable electricity. But perhaps the most interesting aspect is power trading between France and Germany on that day. Craig Morris explains. At the end of July, the storm Zeljko passed over northern Europe, causing considerable wind damage and flooding in some areas.</p><img src="http://energytransition.de/files/2015/07/renewable_powerproduction_week30_2015.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Humans Who Dream Of Companies That Won't Need Us</h1><p>Like other serious crypto-anarchist visionaries, the 21-year-old Russian Canadian entrepreneur Vitalik Buterin sees the blockchain-the public ledger underlying bitcoin-as a way to liberate us all from inefficiency, cut out the middleman, and make big government and business bow at the free market's feet. What makes his vision different is its scope.</p><img src="http://e.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/1280/poster/2015/06/3047462-poster-p-1-a-the-humans-who-dream-of-companies-that-wont-need-them.jpg"></article>]]></description>
