            <title><![CDATA[Ethereum and Oracles]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ethereum and Oracles</h1><p>One of the more popular proposals for implementing smart contracts differently from the way they are typically presented in Ethereum is through the concept of oracles. Essentially, instead of a long-running contract being run directly on the blockchain, all funds that are intended to go into the contract would instead go into an M-of-N multisig address controlled by a set of specialized entities called “oracles”, and the contract code would be simultaneously sent to all of these entities. Every time someone wants to send a message to the contract, they would send the message to the oracles. The oracles would run the code, and if the code execution leads to a withdrawal from the contract to some particular address then the oracles circulate a transaction sending the funds and sign it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ab25511acc1b28e2913ec9da1bfdf68b6b5cfa20.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sid Meier - The man who made a million empires</h1><p>Not many creators have the brazen audacity to slap their name in the actual titles of the things they create. John Lennon didn't call his 1971 album, "John Lennon's Imagine." Mrs. Dalloway isn't called "Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway." James Cameron has so far managed to keep his name out of all his movie titles.  But a lot of Sid Meier's games flash the words "Sid Meier" right there in the title. Most famously: the Sid Meier's Civilization series, which has sold more than 33 million units over the past 25 years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/675892c85473dee85e477df071fbb5b12b9ad25a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
