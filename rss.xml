            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Antarctic fungi survive Martian conditions on the International Space Station</h1><p>European scientists have gathered tiny fungi that take shelter in Antarctic rocks and sent them to the International Space Station. After 18 months on board in conditions similar to those on Mars, more than 60% of their cells remained intact, with stable DNA. The results provide new information for the search for life on the red planet.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/96c4a19f4c6efadd951cb1f99caa8812db5929b6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Basic Income</h1><p>We're going to try something new-our first Request For Research. We'd like to fund a study on basic income-i.e., giving people enough money to live on with no strings attached. I've been intrigued by the idea for a while, and although there's been a lot of discussion, there's fairly little data about how it would work.</p></article>]]></description>
