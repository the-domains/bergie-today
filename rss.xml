            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Hardest Working Person At Silicon Valley's Most Important Startup Isn't a Person</h1><p>When you walk into the San Francisco headquarters of GitHub- the startup that sits at the heart of the software universe-it looks as if you've walked into the White House. The lobby is a wonderfully amusing recreation of the Oval Office, right down to the striped wallpaper, the gold curtains, and the American flag in the corner.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hubot-featured-1200x630-e1445557835983.jpg"></article>]]></description>

For any other company that would be a wonky distraction from its core business. At Google, the two are intertwined.</p><img src="http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i.ilGX8_US7U/v1/-1x-1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Some Finnish Engineers Would Like You To Put This Tiny Square Computer In Your Pocket</h1><p>Solu is a coaster-sized cloud-based portable computer that fits in your pocket. A team of Finnish engineers behind the device hope Solu will change the way we think of using our digital operating systems. Sure, we already have our portable computing devices such as iPads and smartphones, but Solu founder Kristoffer Lawson wants us to stop lugging all our heavy laptops and notebooks around and jump into the cloud-based era of "computer-as-a-service."</p><img src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/solu-social-e1445545933118.png?w=678&h=335"></article>]]></description>

McKinsey & Company noted that the handsets were heavy, batteries didn't last long, coverage was patchy, and the cost per minute was exorbitant. It predicted that in 20 years the total market size would be about 900,000 units, and advised AT&T to pull out.</p><img src="http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-09-11/Bloomberg/201690075.jpg"></article>]]></description>
