            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Dream Chaser DNA: A story of spaceplane evolution</h1><p>Since the earliest days of the space age there has been something inherently attractive in the idea of a spacecraft that could glide back after its mission and land like an aeroplane. From Sanger's Silbervogel onwards, a succession of spaceplanes sporting various shapes and configurations have flowed from the minds of aerospace designers.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/14128525d96b23419f19bff4477ba28822ccae1d.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Motion with Meaning: Semantic Animation in Interface Design</h1><p>Animation is fast becoming an essential part of interface design, and it’s easy to see why. It gives us a whole new dimension to play with—time. This creates opportunities to make our interfaces better at every level: it can make them easier to understand, more pleasant to use, and nicer to look at.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/34784de9ff1993235bf7433b52eeee06642fcc6a.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Renaissance Florence Was a Better Model for Innovation than Silicon Valley Is]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Renaissance Florence Was a Better Model for Innovation than Silicon Valley Is</h1><p>Urban planners the world over yearn to replicate the success of Silicon Valley: witness Thames Valley (England) and Silicon Oasis (Dubai), to name just two of these attempts. Invariably, these well-intentioned efforts fail for the simple reason that they’re trying to replicate the wrong model. Silicon Valley is too new, too now, to glean lessons from. Those hoping to launch the world’s next great innovation hub would be better off looking to an older, even more remarkable genius cluster: Renaissance Florence. The Italian city-state produced an explosion of great art and brilliant ideas, the likes of which the world has not seen before or since. This hothouse of innovation offers lessons as relevant and valuable today as they were 500 years ago. Here are a few of them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/505fc39e9c99e342ddcafa6a8ded3d25138a94cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
