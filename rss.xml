            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Smartwatches and the three-second rule</h1><p>Smartwatches are still in their PDA phase. That seems like a pretty obvious conclusion when you give the category of wearables even a moment's thought. Personal Digital Assistants like the Palm Pilot or Pocket PCs or even Apple's Newton were usually not very useful unless you regularly synced them with your "real" computer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0ea395c98fe9228bb92a673e3bd26d0906936db8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Slaughter at the bridge: uncovering a colossal Bronze Age battle</h1><p>About 3200 years ago, two armies clashed at a river crossing near the Baltic Sea. The confrontation can't be found in any history books-the written word didn't become common in these parts for another 2000 years-but this was no skirmish between local clans.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0c43ae11986d5ee2094ded6653c1149f2ef9395e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Twitter taught Microsoft's AI chatbot to be a racist asshole in less than a day</h1><p>It took less than 24 hours for Twitter to corrupt an innocent AI chatbot. Yesterday, Microsoft unveiled Tay - a Twitter bot that the company described as an experiment in "conversational understanding." The more you chat with Tay, said Microsoft, the smarter it gets, learning to engage people through "casual and playful conversation."</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/67925df2dc7a3e8726e0ec2848f02d820f602eb4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>NASA images show Ceres' brightest spot in spectacular detail</h1><p>The large, bright spot on Ceres can be seen in the most detailed images yet taken from NASA's Dawn spacecraft, which has been orbiting the dwarf planet for a year. The pictures, taken just 240 miles (385 kilometers) above the surface, show that the region known as Occator Crater is comprised of a complex mixture of land formations, deepening the mystery of how the area formed.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9b5702a3cf4627abef8649e51a8fa2af63bd282c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it's a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong . 3. Design is an iterative process.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cc26de271fca141bb6c949a38c56e95a00c86435.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why the iPad Pro Is the Greatest Travel Gadget</h1><p>A few minutes before our Delta flight touches down in Austin, Texas, the flight attendant walks through the plane's aisle one last time. Tray tables and seats in their upright and locked position, please. Bags underneath the seat in front of you.
