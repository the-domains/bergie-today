            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The car century was a mistake. It's time to move on.</h1><p>We must first remember that all cities were car-free little more than a century ago. Not all cities responded to the advent of automobiles with the same enthusiasm as the cities of the United States. In fact, some cities never did adopt the car. Venice was unwilling to destroy itself in order to build streets wide enough for cars, and therefore has never had them except in a sliver near the mainland. The same situation exists in the Medina of Fez, Morocco, and several other North African cities. These districts are usually the most vibrant parts of their cities.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/024a66951dcb913bb26d78a1696482f5eb579d04.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>IPFS Introduction by Example</h1><p>IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a synthesis of well-tested internet technologies such as DHTs, the Git versioning system and Bittorrent. It creates a P2P swarm that allows the exchange of IPFS objects. The totality of IPFS objects forms a cryptographically authenticated data structure known as a Merkle DAG and this data structure can be used to model many other data structures.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ebf107a96e2f5647dd5ce6a7f3d7c54c0fcdabf.png"></article>]]></description>
