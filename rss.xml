That's one heaping teaspoon of life-time, but you know what? It doesn't feel like it.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Dream Chaser DNA: A story of spaceplane evolution</h1><p>Since the earliest days of the space age there has been something inherently attractive in the idea of a spacecraft that could glide back after its mission and land like an aeroplane.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Motion with Meaning: Semantic Animation in Interface Design</h1><p>Animation is fast becoming an essential part of interface design, and it’s easy to see why. It gives us a whole new dimension to play with—time. This creates opportunities to make our interfaces better at every level: it can make them easier to understand, more pleasant to use, and nicer to look at.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/34784de9ff1993235bf7433b52eeee06642fcc6a.png"></article>]]></description>
