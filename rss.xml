            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Artificial intelligence and language</h1><p>The concept of artificial intelligence has been around for a long time. We're all familiar with HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey, C-3PO from Star Wars and, more recently, Samantha from Her. In written fiction, AI characters show up in stories from writers like Philip K. Dick, William Gibson and Isaac Asimov.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5548ae3b0b2574dd7d0a48ad36c960d967c8ee15.jpg"></article>]]></description>
