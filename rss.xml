            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Simple Guide to Finding a JavaScript Memory Leak in Node.js</h1><p>Few months ago, I had to debug a memory leak in Node.js.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why I Am a Sociomediapath</h1><p>During the 1990s I started to get worried about the effect that email might have on my ability to function as a novelist. I ended up writing a little essay entitled "Why I Am a Bad Correspondent" which has since been read by many people and reprinted in "Some Remarks." Its subject was plain old email. This was long before the ubiquitous mobile Internet came along to bring us worldwide, 24/7 social media platforms exquisitely tuned to make us want to check them every few minutes--and to intrude on our screens with notifications when we fail to do so.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3b80df2404bd2ff46ddeedfa4a32c0ac6432cc4a.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The search for the killer bot</h1><p>As 2016 dawns, there's a sense in Silicon Valley that the decades-old fantasy of a true digital assistant is due to roar back into the mainstream. If the trend in past years has been assistants powered by voice - Siri, Alexa, Cortana - in 2016 the focus is shifting to text.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/47333a4742da933f73deba4a546089c42f696ff2.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Phablet Era</h1><p>It's very much a normal distribution centered around the 5.5″-6″ mobile phone (phablet). There are still some people out there using smaller mobile phones and small tablets, but much of the world is converging around a single large phone. That makes sense.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5a6523a6ff61b78b82d43b12acd7d6ca596e60df.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Abandoned Colony in Greenland: Archaeologists Find Clues to Viking Mystery</h1><p>On Sept. 14, 1408, Thorstein Olafsson and Sigrid Björnsdottir were married. The ceremony took place in a church on Hvalsey Fjord in Greenland that was only five meters (about 16 feet) tall. It must have been difficult for the bride and groom to recognize each other in the dim light of the church.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9be0b47421c2bcaf6e693ce38254d9777126f0a3.jpg"></article>]]></description>
