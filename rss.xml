            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Motion with Meaning: Semantic Animation in Interface Design</h1><p>Animation is fast becoming an essential part of interface design, and it’s easy to see why. It gives us a whole new dimension to play with—time. This creates opportunities to make our interfaces better at every level: it can make them easier to understand, more pleasant to use, and nicer to look at.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f1ebf249020a0df08006ffeaad5a3d6c89083956.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Renaissance Florence Was a Better Model for Innovation than Silicon Valley Is]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Renaissance Florence Was a Better Model for Innovation than Silicon Valley Is</h1><p>Urban planners the world over yearn to replicate the success of Silicon Valley: witness Thames Valley (England) and Silicon Oasis (Dubai), to name just two of these attempts. Invariably, these well-intentioned efforts fail for the simple reason that they’re trying to replicate the wrong model. Silicon Valley is too new, too now, to glean lessons from. Those hoping to launch the world’s next great innovation hub would be better off looking to an older, even more remarkable genius cluster: Renaissance Florence. The Italian city-state produced an explosion of great art and brilliant ideas, the likes of which the world has not seen before or since. This hothouse of innovation offers lessons as relevant and valuable today as they were 500 years ago. Here are a few of them.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/505fc39e9c99e342ddcafa6a8ded3d25138a94cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Will decline in driver licenses impact car ownership?</h1><p>If you read the news, there is a growing sense that car ownership as we know it is going to be thing of the past. The rise of Uber and other car sharing services has made not owning a car an option for a good portion of the population, especially those who are (big) city dwellers.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b9e7ae9df63f923fdf61b46cf04b81f4431ba1a7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Conversation With Erik Spiekermann</h1><p>Erik Spiekermann has forgotten more things than most successful and creative people know in their lifetime. Now in his sixties (68), the German-born designer and typography guru remains as excited about the future as ever.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In the Beginning was the Command Line</h1><p>A huge stack of accordion-fold paper sat on the floor underneath each one of these glorified teletypes, and miles of paper shuddered through their platens. Almost all of this paper was thrown away or recycled without ever having been touched by ink--an ecological atrocity so glaring that those machines soon replaced by video terminals--so-called "glass teletypes"--which were quieter and didn't waste paper.</p></article>]]></description>
