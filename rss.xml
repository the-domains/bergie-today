            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Living Lightly with the One-Bag Lifestyle</h1><p>I've been on a handful of long trips this year and in recent years, and on all those trips, I lived out of a small bag. I loved living so lightly, but every time I came home, it felt weird: all of a sudden I had about 10x more stuff.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The /now page movement</h1><p>People often ask me what I’m doing now.  Each time I would type out a reply, describing where I’m at, what I’m focused on, and what I’m not.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The first great works of digital literature are already being written</h1><p>It's an unfortunate feature of working as both a novelist and a games designer that I end up sitting through a lot of panels, round-tables, conferences, discussions and other exercises in head-nodding where digital people try to get to grips with storytelling, or where story people try to understand the digital world.</p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3630dec095cebc18056cc5d0c87aec5ef49eb4/53_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=1200&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=35451dbe004af1a285fea87bee3fa99b"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Programmable blockchains in context: Ethereum's Future</h1><p>By the end of this article, you're going to understand blockchains in general (and Ethereum, a next-generation blockchain platform, in particular) well enough to decide what they mean to your life. Ethereum brings up strong emotions. Some have compared it to SkyNet, the distributed artificial intelligence of the Terminator movies.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*gJIoEfJ9vHsZRwFiqRMlvQ.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google's AMP-an Internet giant tackles the old myth of "the Web is too slow"</h1><p>There's a story going around today that the Web is too slow, especially over mobile networks. It's a pretty good story-and it's a perpetual story. The Web, while certainly improved from the days of 14.4k modems, has never been as fast as we want it to be, which is to say that the Web has never been instantaneous.</p><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-02-at-1.38.09-PM-640x475.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How We Moved 34,000 WIRED Pages to One Site in 9 Hours</h1><p>WIRED is old enough to legally drink. And while those 20-plus years of bound paper will look beautiful on the shelf for a long time to come, we don't have that luxury on the web. And so we've done some much-needed housecleaning. The story of WIRED.com reflects the boom-bust-boom Silicon Valley we cover.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FEATURED-edletter_final-2-1200x630.jpg"></article>]]></description>
