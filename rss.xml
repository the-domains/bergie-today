            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This New Campaign Wants To Help Surveillance Agents Quit NSA or GCHQ</h1><p>Support groups help cult and gang members break free of their former lives. Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous help addicts overcome their dependencies. And now one group of privacy campaigners wants to offer its target audience an escape route for what it sees as a equally insidious trap: Their jobs working for intelligence agencies like the NSA.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nsmail-2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One Weird Trick to Write Better Code</h1><p>In summary, design data structures to match your specific problem. Don't shoehorn a single concept into a bunch of separate, encapsulated objects.  Next, write functions that leave the smallest possible footprint on that data. If possible, write pure stateless functions.  That's the trick.</p><img src="http://etodd.io/assets/data-flow.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Nasa scientists find evidence of flowing water on Mars</h1><p>Liquid water runs down canyons and crater walls over the summer months on Mars, according to researchers who say the discovery raises the odds of the planet being home to some form of life. The trickles leave long, dark stains on the Martian terrain that can reach hundreds of metres downhill in the warmer months, before they dry up in the autumn as surface temperatures drop.</p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ff58e198dcc3eb84bb4b3b5463dddd17c289fe/379_0_2431_1459/master/2431.jpg?w=1200&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=82c416b131a3d0f69d4ed735b477693b"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wait, what? Mobile browser traffic is 2X bigger than app traffic, and growing faster</h1><p>Mobile browser traffic is actually twice that of mobile app traffic, according to a just-released Morgan Stanley report that rates Google's stock as a buy. This appears to fly in the face of recent, strong, and repeated evidence that the app is winning, capturing 80-90 percent of our time on mobile.</p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mobile-phone-apps.jpg?fit=780%2C9999"></article>]]></description>
