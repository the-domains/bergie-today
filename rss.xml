            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>basic infrastructure patterns</h1><p>Some basic patterns I've noticed come up over and over again while working on build/CI/deployment related things. The pipeline is the bedrock on which pretty much everything else is built. A properly designed pipeline takes well-defined inputs and produces well-defined outputs or it halts somewhere and indicates exactly what failed.</p></article>]]></description>

Not that this was unusual for New York, mused the controller manning LaGuardia's airport's tower, but it meant he'd have to remember to wrap up extra warm when he headed home. He looked at his watch.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4f593e0baf458a251a2c43c35549201b4c204cfe.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The fantasy of flight: Porco Rosso and Miyazaki's lifelong obsession</h1><p>Miyazaki’s obsession with flight is evident throughout his films. In fact, flying sequences feature in all but three of his 11 pictures (Ponyo, Princess Mononoke and The Castle of Cagliostro are the exceptions). Flight, in general, is often central to the plot, most notably in 2014’s The Wind Rises (about an aviation engineer) and 1992’s wonderful fantasy Porco Rosso, about a flying pig.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0969c9f51b1c25e6266a2970a48aab453d0458ec.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The App-ocalypse: can Web standards make mobile apps obsolete?</h1><p>It's the apps. The iPhone and Android conquered the world because of the apps. More specifically, what keeps Android and iOS dominant is the utter lack of those apps on competing platforms. But today, the mobile landscape is significantly different than it was a year or two ago (let alone five).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dd2266844c1ad9dd7f9d814daa2b2f366aabee00.png"></article>]]></description>
