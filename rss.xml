            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The fantasy of flight: Porco Rosso and Miyazaki's lifelong obsession</h1><p>Miyazaki’s obsession with flight is evident throughout his films. In fact, flying sequences feature in all but three of his 11 pictures (Ponyo, Princess Mononoke and The Castle of Cagliostro are the exceptions). Flight, in general, is often central to the plot, most notably in 2014’s The Wind Rises (about an aviation engineer) and 1992’s wonderful fantasy Porco Rosso, about a flying pig.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0969c9f51b1c25e6266a2970a48aab453d0458ec.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The App-ocalypse: can Web standards make mobile apps obsolete?</h1><p>It's the apps. The iPhone and Android conquered the world because of the apps. More specifically, what keeps Android and iOS dominant is the utter lack of those apps on competing platforms.
