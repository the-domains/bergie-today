            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Planning the Software Industrial Revolution</h1><p>The possibility of a software industrial revolution, in which programmers stop coding everything from scratch and begin assembling applications from well-stocked catalogs of reusable software components, is an enduring dream that continues to elude our grasp. Although object-oriented programming has brought the software industrial revolution a step closer, common-sense organizational principles like reusability and interchangeability are still the exception rather than the rule.</p><img src="http://virtualschool.edu/cox/pub/PSIR/PSIR4.gif"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Volkswagen and Cheating Software</h1><p>For the past six years, Volkswagen has been cheating on the emissions testing for its diesel cars. The cars' computers were able to detect when they were being tested, and temporarily alter how their engines worked so they looked much cleaner than they actually were.</p><img src="https://www.schneier.com/images/book-dg-175w.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This New Campaign Wants To Help Surveillance Agents Quit NSA or GCHQ</h1><p>Support groups help cult and gang members break free of their former lives. Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous help addicts overcome their dependencies. And now one group of privacy campaigners wants to offer its target audience an escape route for what it sees as a equally insidious trap: Their jobs working for intelligence agencies like the NSA.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nsmail-2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A cartoon Guide to Flux</h1><p>Flux is both one of the most popular and one of the least understood topics in current web development. This guide is an attempt to explain it in a way everyone can understand. First, I should explain the basic problem that Flux solves. Flux is a pattern for handling data in your application.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rNyINoYDbC53QNgHuTwriA.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>We Are Living in a Robot Moment - Rejoice, Cower, and Copulate?</h1><p>Every story about robots is in some way a story about death. Sometimes it's the human race that gets it. Sometimes it's a tiny plastic dog. Last summer, Sony discontinued the last remaining traces of customer support for its AIBO series. Remember the AIBO?</p><img src="https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/robotsmariozucca.jpg?quality=100&strip=all&w=2048"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>One Weird Trick to Write Better Code</h1><p>In summary, design data structures to match your specific problem. Don't shoehorn a single concept into a bunch of separate, encapsulated objects.  Next, write functions that leave the smallest possible footprint on that data. If possible, write pure stateless functions.  That's the trick.</p><img src="http://etodd.io/assets/data-flow.png"></article>]]></description>
