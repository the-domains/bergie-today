            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why is Vertical Rhythm an Important Typography Practice?</h1><p>You probably heard of the term Vertical Rhythm if you researched a little about typography on the web. It's one of the most important practices when working with typography. I've used Vertical Rhythm on all my sites ever since I read about it.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The New Web Typography</h1><p>We can trace a nervous path through the links and hearts that occupy our timelines. In search of answers, we’ve peeked under the covers of Material Design and examined hundreds of pattern libraries, since one of them might be secretly withholding the principles of good design within. But why are we obsessed with typographic rules? And if we were to make guidelines for setting text on the web, what form should those rules take?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/374b7f9883b87e902eda2f9953e3e832f33a2b83.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Testing, Testing - One, Two, Hands Free</h1><p>We wanted to explore what the future of mobile payments could look like. Imagine if you could rush through a drive-thru without reaching for your wallet, or pick up a hot dog at the ballpark without fumbling to pass coins or your credit card to the cashier. This prompted us to build a pilot app called Hands Free that we’re now in the early stages of testing. It lets you pay in stores quickly, easily, and completely hands-free.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bb48c1629224306294adb349378001b617100c95.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid - Beta</h1><p>There are a lot of things going on under the hood.  The system is analyzing my photos, adding color filters to match my branding (which was in turn created from the system analyzing a picture I chose, in the first place).  Then it attempts to place title text in places that don’t overlap important parts of the images.  You make a few other choices, layout, type formality and then the AI builds you a site.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/32a723ccd69abc75360842dbe40c06973000dcca.png"></article>]]></description>
