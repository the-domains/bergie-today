            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Introducing Safari Technology Preview</h1><p>Starting today, there’s a new, convenient way to see what features and improvements are coming to Safari and other applications that use WebKit. Safari Technology Preview is a version of Safari for OS X, distributed by Apple, that includes a cutting-edge, in-development version of the WebKit browser engine. It’s a great way to test upcoming WebKit features and give feedback to the people building them when it’s most useful — early in development.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e4a1537ef515cf4c94f4b7c2980e6093a628b559.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ubuntu on Windows -- The Ubuntu Userspace for Windows Developers</h1><p>I'm in San Francisco this week, attending Microsoft's Build developer conference, as a sponsored guest of Microsoft. That's perhaps a bit odd for me, as I hadn't used Windows in nearly 16 years. But that changed a few months ago, as I embarked on a super secret (and totally mind boggling!) project between Microsoft and Canonical, as unveiled today in a demo during Kevin Gallo's opening keynote of the Build conference....</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cc347c298a18bcb587bc60514611e3b537eda027.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>When our culture's past is lost in the cloud</h1><p>Imagine if the Declaration were composed today. It would almost certainly be written on a computer screen rather than with ink and paper, and the edits would be made electronically, through email exchanges or a file shared on the Internet. If we were lucky, a modern-day Jefferson would turn on track-changes and print copies of the document as it progressed. We’d at least know who wrote what, even if the generic computer type lacked the expressiveness of handwriting. More likely, the digital file would come to be erased or rendered unreadable by changes in technical standards. We’d have the words, but the document itself would have little resonance.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c478767a37610ab18f65ef1254f7c42fe0c775b7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Power Water Networks</h1><p>During the second half of the nineteenth century, water motors were widely used in Europe and America. These small water turbines were connected to the tap and could power any machine that is now driven by electricity. As we have seen in a previous article, operating motors with tap water was not very sustainable.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/097a635e5a0c5ee4cab75578e560a45d80fc2045.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Helped by the rise of cheap smartphone displays, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey took a technology that most people considered a retro curiosity and convinced them that it could change the world.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/82da78a24cea85376d815ae3581c98bd646f245b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

And at first blush, it seems a bit of a daft idea. A company called Bigelow Aerospace wants to build space stations for the government and hotels for private customers that will inflate like balloons once they reach outer space.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4b893f9d9c5de7fce03f76036d6f8c54f092c1c7.jpg"></article>]]></description>
