            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Estonia's e-Residency Program Is the Future of Immigration</h1><p>A few years ago, Estonia had a problem. The small, Baltic nation had spent the past several decades in the midst of a technological revolution, using the term "e-Estonia" to describe a set of sweeping digital reforms: Citizens could vote online, pay their taxes online, and track government legislation online.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5a6ec847fee63ae4c3cad325864e235e958a5bbf.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Deutsche Bahn looking at adding autonomous cars to its mass transit network</h1><p>German railway giant Deutsche Bahn is working on adding autonomous cars to its transport network as a way of getting riders to and from the train station - the last mile, so to speak. It's even looking at competing with companies like Uber in getting travelers around urban areas where a train might not be practical.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ea5d1d00fcb00f5c04e4821221f51defe0adae30.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA["[...] is a toy"]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>"[...] is a toy"</h1><p>As many have recognized, when inventions and innovations first appear they are often (always) labeled as “toys” or “incapable” of doing “real work” or providing “real entertainment”. Of course, many new inventions don’t work out the way inventors had hoped, though quite frequently it is just a matter of timing and the coming together of a variety of circumstances. It can be said that being labeled a toy is necessary, but not sufficient, to become the next big thing.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0f79a8e8ad517bbd583cf402a8d5cce4d3724b91.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why the Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt are going to kill the gas station</h1><p>For as many plaudits as Tesla has received for its cars, plenty of its success must lie with that network of Superchargers. The far-sighted idea to build out the recharging infrastructure necessary to make road trips possible in an electric vehicle has surely done much to win friends, particularly among those vocal drivers for whom the inability of a car to drive across several of the smaller states in a day is an instant disqualification.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9226ab8d2068cc1e530a3c5999377b0bbdcd1fda.jpg"></article>]]></description>
