            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>License to (Not) Drive</h1><p>An exclusive look behind the scenes at Google's autonomous car testing center I have backed out of a lot of parking spaces in my life, but today is different. As I adjust the mirrors, fasten the safety belt, turn on the ignition, and put the Lexus RX450h SUV in reverse, I feel the scrutiny of my passengers, professionals who may be skeptical of my ability to control the vehicle.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-Sq4yMuoBPAFXDx5nRVpKg.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Enhancing images using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)</h1><p>Recently a very impressive paper came out which produced some extremely life-like images generated from a neural network. Since I wrote a post about convolutional autoencoders about 9 months ago, I have been thinking about the problem of how one could upscale or 'enhance' an image, CSI-style, by using a neural network to fill in...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/efd0d73f2dc5e8d8281724b3094613883389eefd.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Big Red Button</h1><p>Automation is all around us: elevators, automatic doors at the supermarket, and auto-pilots on airplanes.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hackers and Heroes: Rise of the CCC and Hackerspaces</h1><p>From its roots in phone phreaking to the crackdowns and legal precedents that drove hacking mostly underground (or into business), hacker culture in the United States has seen a lot over the last three decades. Perhaps the biggest standout is the L0pht, a visible 1990s US hackerspace that engaged in open disclosure and was, arguably, the last of the publicly influential US hacker groups.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/da3b25ecbea0233f585706fe0de31d2d97a3f958.jpg"></article>]]></description>
