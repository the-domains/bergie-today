            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Dolphins Are Helping Us Hunt for Aliens</h1><p>When twelve men gathered at the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia to discuss the art and science of alien hunting in 1961, the Order of the Dolphin was born. A number of the brightest minds from a range of scientific disciplines, including three Nobel laureates, a young Carl Sagan, and an eccentric neuroscientist named John Lilly-who was best known for trying to talk to dolphins-were in attendance.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dfe3b10529cabecf382adf2250a1d1bd66b0e702.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It no longer seems like such a goofy idea</h1><p>Throughout our planet's space-faring history, there have been two major impediments to putting a lot of private citizens into orbit. Only governments have had spacecraft, and there have been only a few, government-controlled, space stations to visit. But now that may finally changing in a big way.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d83d67a7d53a5e25e15266ea03dab94cba53ee33.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It's a love/hate relationship because I've had some truly great times in cars, and I can appreciate the idea of a high-speed personal comfort bubble that lets you criss-cross the country with friends and stuff along for the ride.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8992768acde17359e19dc08e2ef2c973c9460b28.jpg"></article>]]></description>

When the Texel Divers Club glimpsed a package in the sand-buried remains of a sunken ship off the island of Texel in the Wadden Sea, they brought it to the surface-only to discover it held a wealthy lady's most prized possessions: a silk damask dress, velvet embroidered purse, perfume ball, lice comb, stockings, and books bound in beautiful leather.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4cbf197b0dd5b3c9a8ba8ee7455a1899432f93bd.jpg"></article>]]></description>
