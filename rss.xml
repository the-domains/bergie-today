            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>No Sailors Needed: Robot Sailboats Scour the Oceans for Data</h1><p>The Saildrone's carbon fiber sail acts like an aircraft wing. When air passes over it, thrust is created. The sail is stabilized by a counterweight that is placed in front of it and a tab trailing behind it that can automatically make small corrections to make sure it maintains an efficient angle to the wind.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/61ac24ba5e6499ba02329648dabd2e7a/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic01.nyt.com%2Fimages%2F2016%2F08%2F31%2Fbusiness%2F00saildrone-1%2F00saildrone-1-facebookJumbo.jpg"></article>]]></description>
