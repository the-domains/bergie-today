            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>World Energy Hits a Turning Point: Solar That's Cheaper Than Wind</h1><p>A transformation is happening in global energy markets that's worth noting as 2016 comes to an end: Solar power, for the first time, is becoming the cheapest form of new electricity.

And yet, over a year later, the iPad Pro is, by far, the best computer I've ever owned. I've never felt so satisfied with any other Apple device before - but the transition wasn't easy.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/271f319b92e974c9aba9339074abcada/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2F2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com%2F2016-12-13-22-29-30.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Microsoft is about to turn a phone into a real PC</h1><p>Microsoft is bringing a full version of Windows 10, complete with desktop app support, to ARM chipsets. The software giant demonstrated Windows 10 running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip today, complete with HD video playback, Adobe Photoshop support, and Microsoft Office. Microsoft expects ARM-based laptops to be the first to adopt this new version of Windows 10. Traditional x86 desktop apps will be emulated, making the experience seamless to the end user. Laptops might be the first, but itâ€™s easy to see past that and realize that this means Microsoft is about to turn a phone into a real PC.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c409d0e1-f8e6-4313-a1b1-3f259e4370d2.jpg"></article>]]></description>
