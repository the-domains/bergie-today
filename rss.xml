            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Google's Allo messaging app is a big step backwards</h1><p>A year ago, when Google began to unwind Google+, it felt like a positive sign for the company's underperforming social efforts. After sinking years into building a product overstuffed with photos, communication tools, link-sharing, and discussions, Google began to shrink them into more manageable tools. The results were largely positive.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/10834985271fad04b54dbfb96c11124ef92ad153.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The most spectacular portion of this event was the first successful night landing of the Falcon 9‚Äôs first stage onboard their floating platform called ‚ÄúOf Course I Still Love You.‚Äù While this was not the first successful landing for SpaceX, it was the first one at sea at night and also one that they predicted to have a high probability of failure due to the dynamics involved with the much higher energy needed to send the satellite to a higher orbit than previous launches</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2e925ed730c521055c4fe5fbc3c77b83359b4dd3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The slow death of purposeless walking</h1><p>A number of recent books have lauded the connection between walking - just for its own sake - and thinking. But are people losing their love of the purposeless walk? Walking is a luxury in the West.
