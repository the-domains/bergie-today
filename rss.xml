            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google threatens Qualcomm Quick Charge with Android "incompatibility"</h1><p>The proliferation of USB Type-C is making charging various devices easier than ever. Smartphones (other than the iPhone) and laptops are unifying under a single charging port, allowing any charger to plug into anything else. Today you can plug your Type-C phone into your Type-C laptop charger, and charging will happen.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/c22fc7fe89012769a0b497995467c4f3/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F05%2FUSB-Type-C-macro-image-640x215.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Benefits of using tmux - lessons from streamlining a development environment</h1><p>Before I started using tmux, I’d hear it mentioned frequently. It always sounded cool, and while there’s no shortage of great information on the web about what tmux is, it was never entirely clear to me how it would dramatically improve my development workflow. After using tmux for a few years, I’ve come to rely on its ability to streamline several aspects of my development process. Thanks to tmux, my workflow is now more organized, more automated, and easier to customize. My hope is that by sharing a few concrete examples of how tmux has helped me, it may help others better understand what might be gained by taking tmux for a spin.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/1ca94fc3932f38c4d9deed4824ff0d08/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.bugsnag.com%2Fimg%2Fposts%2Fconsistent-dev-1.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Genetically Engineered Bacteria Will Be Our Martian Architects</h1><p>Every building starts with a strong foundation - pouring concrete into a hole, constructing on top of it.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Redesigning Waxy, 2016 edition</h1><p>"Redesigning your blog" in 2016 is an anachronism.
