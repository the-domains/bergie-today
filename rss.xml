            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Culture, mathematical models, and Neandertal extinction</h1><p>I am not philosophically opposed to building a mathematical model of Neandertal populations. Some of my best work has involved mathematical model-building. Models have an important place in helping us to understand evolutionary history. But when it comes to understanding Neandertal and modern human interactions, we have had lots and lots and lots of models and few testable predictions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/67cdba0b216e7e2a25c6329c1b82a7bfbb058e2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Working on the iPad: One Year Later, Still My Favorite Computer</h1><p>Four years ago, I struggled to move from a Mac to an iPad. Today, I only have to open my MacBook once a week. And I wish I didn't have to.  In February 2015, after years of experiments and workarounds, I shared the story of how the iPad Air 2 became my primary computer. The article, while unsurprising for MacStories readers who had been following my iPad coverage since 2012, marked an important milestone in my journey towards being Mac-free.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cc4bd7b385fcaa009436b99eaeac0c4adb32e506.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>So you want to build a generator...</h1><p>This is a beginner-level advice essay for people just getting started with building generators. It’s also for practiced experts who want a way to organize their knowledge.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Mir Space Station Was a Marvel, a Clusterfuck, and an Underdog Hero</h1><p>The core module of the iconic Mir space station, launched 30 years ago Saturday, was a cramped living space that could barely support two cosmonauts. But over the years, the station evolved like a multicellular organism, sprouting six more pressurized limbs from the DOS-7 base block to become the largest spacefaring vessel of its day, as well as the first continuously inhabited orbital outpost in human history.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ba96c38c682584a033cfc6824045810eac448d23.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This image of Mark Zuckerberg says so much about our future</h1><p>The image above looks like concept art for a new dystopian sci-fi film. A billionaire superman with a rictus grin, striding straight past human drones, tethered to machines and blinded to reality by blinking plastic masks. Golden light shines down on the man as he strides past his subjects, cast in gloom, toward a stage where he will accept their adulation.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c0b3dace12bd9fd10a675656a0501d796ba892ec.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What sparked the Cambrian explosion?</h1><p>A series of dark, craggy pinnacles rises 80 metres above the grassy plains of Namibia. The peaks call to mind something ancient - the burial mounds of past civilizations or the tips of vast pyramids buried by the ages. The stone formations are indeed monuments of a faded empire, but not from anything hewn by human hands.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/95460d470269b97e130b554a23256f573ebec016.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What's Next in Computing?</h1><p>The computing industry progresses in two mostly independent cycles: financial and product cycles. There has been a lot of handwringing lately about where we are in the financial cycle. Financial markets get a lot of attention. They tend to fluctuate unpredictably and sometimes wildly.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/73d3bc8eb81b2df2f91fd2c1040e6b1222941025.png"></article>]]></description>
