            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Life as a Robot</h1><p>I have been part robot since May. Instead of legs, I move on gyroscopically stabilized wheels. Instead of a face, I have an iPad screen. Instead of eyes, a camera with no peripheral vision. Instead of a mouth, a speaker whose volume I can't even gauge with my own ears.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/G3A0044-1200x630.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>C-Base Station's Ingress Table</h1><p>In Berlin the c-base station is a favorite hangout for the strong Berlin Tech scene, this is where they often end up after a long session of playing Ingress about town. A while ago the coder Henri Bergius and his cohorts got together in a hackathon to build an Ingress table to hang out around after a session of play. It illustrates in real time the Ingress action in the neighborhood around c-base station, and acts as a station to recharge weary mobile phones.</p><img src="http://architectstables.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ingress-table-test-small-450x337.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch - An Introduction</h1><p>Get the code: To follow along, all the code is also available as an iPython notebook on Github. In this post we will implement a simple 3-layer neural network from scratch. We won't derive all the math that's required, but I will try to give an intuitive explanation of what we are doing.</p><img src="http://www.wildml.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nn-from-scratch-dataset.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Teaching tomorrow</h1><p>"Because of the increased efficiency of machines, it is getting harder and harder for a human to make a productive contribution to society," says Sebastian Thrun. This is what you might expect to hear from the man who suggested Google's controversial Street View project to photograph the world's roadsides, who developed the company's eerie self-driving cars and who founded the secretive Google "skunk-works" project responsible for Glass, a wearable computer that resembles spectacles.</p><img src="http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20150905_TQD005_0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't Worry, Smart Machines Will Take Us With Them</h1><p>When it comes to artificial intelligence, we may all be suffering from the fallacy of availability: thinking that creating intelligence is much easier than it is, because we see examples all around us. In a recent poll, machine intelligence experts predicted that computers would gain human-level ability around the year 2050, and superhuman ability less than 30 years after.</p><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7061_6495cf7ca745a9443508b86951b8e33a.png"></article>]]></description>
