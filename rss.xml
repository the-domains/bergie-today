            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Future of News Is Not An Article</h1><p>In May of this year, Facebook announced Facebook Instant Articles, its foray into innovating the Facebook user experience around news reading. A month later, Apple introduced their own take with their Apple News app, which allows "stories to be specially formatted to look and feel like articles taken from publishers' websites while still living inside Apple's app".</p><img src="http://nytlabs.com/blog/images/particles-head.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Facebook's AI Can Caption Photos for the Blind on Its Own</h1><p>Matt King is blind, so he can't see the photo. And though it was posted to his Facebook feed with a rather lengthy caption, that's no help. Thanks to text-to-speech software, his laptop reads the caption aloud, but it's in German. And King doesn't understand German.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-551958435-big-1200x630-e1445916830625.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>NASA spacecraft to dive into icy geyser on distant world</h1><p>On Wednesday, a school-bus sized spacecraft will dive out of the inky blackness of space more than one billion kilometers from Earth and zip through an icy plume that springs from the south pole of Enceladus. Although it's just a tiny satellite of Saturn-less than one-sixth the size of Earth's moon-Enceladus has become one of the most intriguing bodies in the Solar System.</p><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/543564main_pia07800-full_full-640x320.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Law of Demeter: Some archaeological notes</h1><p>A lot has been written and said about the Law of Demeter. I'd read and heard a lot about the law before I ever went back and looked at the seminal, original papers that described it. In spite of how much I thought I knew about the law, I found those original papers quite enlightening and absorbing.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is solarpunk the new cyberpunk?</h1><p>It’s a new rising speculative fiction genre and aesthetic, along the same lines of Steampunk, Cyberpunk, and others you might have heard of. It pretty much embodies the idea that while the future might be an overwhelming prospect, it doesn’t have to be frightening, and it doesn’t have to hurt.</p><img src="http://www.scifiideas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/solarpunk.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Build a Low-tech Internet</h1><p>Wireless internet access is on the rise in both modern consumer societies and in the developing world. In rich countries, however, the focus is on always-on connectivity and ever higher access speeds. In poor countries, on the other hand, connectivity is achieved through much more low-tech, often asynchronous networks.</p><img src="http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e8883301b7c7e2d9d7970b-800wi"></article>]]></description>
