            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Atom Can't Replace Vim</h1><p>1976 was a good year for text editors. At MIT, Richard Stallman and Guy Steele wrote the first version of Emacs.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bots won't replace apps. Better apps will replace apps.</h1><p>Lately, everyone's talking about "conversational UI." It's the next big thing.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Tablet Has Stickers</h1><p>When I received my new 9.7" iPad Pro I decided to break tablet tradition and personalize it with stickers, just as I've done on laptops (and my Surfaces) for years. I did so because I began with the mindset that this iPad would replace my laptop(s) for full time use (here laptop means my Surface(s), Yoga, MacBook, and desktops).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7205bb0d36642fcbf1eee0853cd2ce6bbba8a5fc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
