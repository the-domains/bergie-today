            <title><![CDATA[Rediscovering the iPad]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rediscovering the iPad</h1><p>It started with two unpleasant feelings: It’s not reliable anymore, and It needs too much babysitting. Harsh, but also fair. My beloved 2015 MacBook 12”, along with its complimentary 2016-model replacement, has been the source of conflicting emotions over the past year.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Webhooks do's and dont's: what we learned after integrating +100 APIs</h1><p>As modern applications are becoming more and more a composite of APIs and the serverless architectures are getting more attention, API providers can't afford any longer to expose only traditional REST endpoints. Traditional REST API are designed for when you want to allow a programmatical retrieve or post content, far from being optimal when you just want your application to be told when something changed.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/b0f22fe972ac11c9f13682a9ed68d801/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1200%2F1*dEmrcTajSG5A4Z_JjrGqfw.png"></article>]]></description>
