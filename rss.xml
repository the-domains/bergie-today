            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google's AMP-an Internet giant tackles the old myth of "the Web is too slow"</h1><p>There's a story going around today that the Web is too slow, especially over mobile networks. It's a pretty good story-and it's a perpetual story. The Web, while certainly improved from the days of 14.4k modems, has never been as fast as we want it to be, which is to say that the Web has never been instantaneous.</p><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-02-at-1.38.09-PM-640x475.png"></article>]]></description>

And while those 20-plus years of bound paper will look beautiful on the shelf for a long time to come, we don't have that luxury on the web. And so we've done some much-needed housecleaning. The story of WIRED.com reflects the boom-bust-boom Silicon Valley we cover.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FEATURED-edletter_final-2-1200x630.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Space station celebrates 15 years of life in space </h1><p>On November 2, 2000, a Russian Soyuz rocket docked at the International Space Station carrying Expedition 1, made up of NASA astronaut William Shepherd and Roscosmos cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev. For 136 days, 17 hours and 9 minutes, they lived in the narrow quarters of the station as it zipped silently around Earth at 5 miles per second, 250 miles above its surface.</p><img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130219113441-space-station-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Do one thing...</h1><p>I've been lamenting the demise of the Unix philosophy: tools should do one thing, and do it well. The ability to connect many small tools is better than having a single tool that does everything poorly. That philosophy was great, but hasn't survived into the Web age.</p><img src="http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2015/10/350px-Pudu_jail_west_wall.jpg"></article>]]></description>
