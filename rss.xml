For the most part, we never think about it. It makes our lives easier, cheaper, and safer. But with every new automation, there is this transitional moment. When something first goes automatic, it is disorienting.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d0623996584ef9e840d47e5635e25f27b5f60aba.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hackers and Heroes: Rise of the CCC and Hackerspaces</h1><p>From its roots in phone phreaking to the crackdowns and legal precedents that drove hacking mostly underground (or into business), hacker culture in the United States has seen a lot over the last three decades. Perhaps the biggest standout is the L0pht, a visible 1990s US hackerspace that engaged in open disclosure and was, arguably, the last of the publicly influential US hacker groups.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/da3b25ecbea0233f585706fe0de31d2d97a3f958.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Even people without modern technology don't sleep the night away, new research says. Members of three hunter-gatherer societies who lack electricity-and thus evenings filled with Facebook, Candy Crush, and 200 TV channels-get an average of only 6.4 hours of shut-eye a night, scientists have found.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4e426aad22fd88797cce57774f36610dce1c3f0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
