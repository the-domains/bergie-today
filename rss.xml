As I adjust the mirrors, fasten the safety belt, turn on the ignition, and put the Lexus RX450h SUV in reverse, I feel the scrutiny of my passengers, professionals who may be skeptical of my ability to control the vehicle.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-Sq4yMuoBPAFXDx5nRVpKg.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Enhancing images using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)</h1><p>Recently a very impressive paper came out which produced some extremely life-like images generated from a neural network. Since I wrote a post about convolutional autoencoders about 9 months ago, I have been thinking about the problem of how one could upscale or 'enhance' an image, CSI-style, by using a neural network to fill in...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/efd0d73f2dc5e8d8281724b3094613883389eefd.png"></article>]]></description>
