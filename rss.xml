One can imagine one of the first programs an owner will write is a filter to eliminate advertising!</p><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*XkQWZNty8gBpkjpwkkjkCA.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Will decline in driver licenses impact car ownership?</h1><p>If you read the news, there is a growing sense that car ownership as we know it is going to be thing of the past. The rise of Uber and other car sharing services has made not owning a car an option for a good portion of the population, especially those who are (big) city dwellers.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b9e7ae9df63f923fdf61b46cf04b81f4431ba1a7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Conversation With Erik Spiekermann</h1><p>Erik Spiekermann has forgotten more things than most successful and creative people know in their lifetime. Now in his sixties (68), the German-born designer and typography guru remains as excited about the future as ever.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In the Beginning was the Command Line</h1><p>A huge stack of accordion-fold paper sat on the floor underneath each one of these glorified teletypes, and miles of paper shuddered through their platens. Almost all of this paper was thrown away or recycled without ever having been touched by ink--an ecological atrocity so glaring that those machines soon replaced by video terminals--so-called "glass teletypes"--which were quieter and didn't waste paper.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Advice for Companies With Less Than 1 Year of Runway</h1><p>The hardest part of dealing with a low runway situation is managing your own psychology. You have to simultaneously manage your own anxiety to not be overly negative about your prospects, but also not be irrationally positive. It's a delicate balance. The first step is to understand exactly how much cash and runway you have.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2480cd811d01860c8ade31b89881cf2f130f56ec.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What's It Like in Space?: Stories from Astronauts Who've Been There</h1><p>Everyone wonders what it's really like in space, but very few of us have ever had the chance to experience it firsthand. This captivating illustrated collection brings together stories from dozens of international astronauts—men and women who've actually been there—who have returned with accounts of the sometimes weird, often funny, and awe-inspiring sensations and realities of being in space. With playful artwork accompanying each, here are the real stories behind backwards dreams, "moon face," the tricks of sleeping in zero gravity and aiming your sneeze during a spacewalk, the importance of packing hot sauce, and dozens of other cosmic quirks and amazements that come with travel in and beyond low Earth orbit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b1cfc82d60c601fdf34aa8438031eae851821255.jpg"></article>]]></description>
