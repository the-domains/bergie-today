            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Nest Reminds Customers That Ownership Isn't What It Used to Be</h1><p>Nest Labs, a home automation company acquired by Google in 2014, will disable some of its customers' home automation control devices in May. This move is causing quite a stir among people who purchased the $300 Revolv Hub devices-customers who reasonably expected that the promised "lifetime" of updates would enable the hardware they paid for to actually work, only to discover the manufacturer can turn their device into a useless brick when it so chooses.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b29986ee8fdc2fc72caad90f1089f614f61f065d.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It's a Tesla</h1><p>Let's start with the caveats: no, Tesla did not sell 276,000 Model 3's in three days; that is the number of fully refundable pre-orders that required a deposit of "only" $1,000. And yes, Tesla has a history of delivering cars late and with a higher price than expected.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0df47fda81a30d75a95ea5c54ea81e4de8eae33c.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Personal observations on the reliability of the Shuttle</h1><p>It appears that there are enormous differences of opinion as to the probability of a failure with loss of vehicle and of human life. The estimates range from roughly 1 in 100 to 1 in 100,000. The higher figures come from the working engineers, and the very low figures from management. What are the causes and consequences of this lack of agreement? Since 1 part in 100,000 would imply that one could put a Shuttle up each day for 300 years expecting to lose only one, we could properly ask "What is the cause of management's fantastic faith in the machinery?"</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5fa837f02df3763b1f34fd2758d38b66502dd6d7.jpg"></article>]]></description>
