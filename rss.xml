Standard, shiny city stuff.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/127a2bc9debeb9ac7316f7f24375d552/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F11%2FSection-Perspective4-1200x630-e1478033240809.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Playing with History: What Sid Meier's Video Game Empire Got Right and Wrong About 'Civilization'</h1><p>The pleasure of Sid Meier’s Civilization series is that it is at once tantalizingly grand and endearingly granular. The game’s approach to the past has always been playful. Abe Lincoln can lead war-bands against Mahatma Gandhi’s phalanxes. The Aztecs can build the first nuclear bomb. Every version of the game begins with the same wide-open promise: a settler, a worker, a few tiles of visible land, and an ocean of darkness—all the ingredients of a world ready to be discovered and made anew.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/3262d82fc91ed81f6e8a4a8b8414616c/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Flongreadsblog.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F10%2Fcivilization-vi-distant-view.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Mechanical Keyboard</h1><p>I’m in the middle of a slow breakup with Apple. It has been painful but, to be honest, the split has been in the works for a few years now. Some people here know that I have been a bit of an Apple obsessive for the last decade plus. I have purchased just about every iPhone, iPad, iPod, iMac and iDontknowwhat. Apple Watch. Apple chargers. Apple Apps. Our house is littered with old Apple products, something that drives my wife Margo absolutely insane.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/59a77b95db0224c1674a55f5a19239a6/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=1223&cropwidth=2582&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Fjoeposnanski.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F10%2FIMG_20161029_155330.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
