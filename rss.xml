            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Future of Computing Is in These Three Computers</h1><p>The three computers I am talking about are: iPad Pro, Surface Pro 4 / Surface Book, and MacBook (12" retina model). You probably suspected the first two given what I have been focused on of late, but that last one you might be questioning.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/67339e7b884801995eaa5fa1c9565e1c8f2b612d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It's the first time SpaceX has been able to gently touch down the Falcon 9 post-launch - something the company has been trying to do for the past year.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c13e77e0ce05de76afdce751449b3a12841762b9.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside Google's Quantum Computing Lab, Questing for the Perfect Computer | MIT Technology Review</h1><p>John Martinis used the arm of his reading glasses to indicate the spot where he intends to demonstrate an almost unimaginably powerful new form of computer in a few years. It is a cylindrical socket an inch and a half across, at the bottom of a torso-sized stack of plates, blocks, and wires of brass, copper, and gold.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aab5c8e7233a70cc91e240425cca7d1ab8aa504e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In search of the perfect notebook</h1><p>When I worked for Scotland Yard in the 1980s I had a Filofax, which was pretty standard for people living in London at the time. I took it with me to Japan and used it for all my notes and planning until it fell to bits, at which point I bought another.</p><img src="http://johnguycollick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/medievalfilofax.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Codebase is an Organism</h1><p>Here's what no one tells you when you graduate with a degree in computer science and take up a job in software engineering: The computer is a machine, but a codebase is an organism. This will make sense to anyone who's worked on a large or even medium-sized software project - but it's often surprising to new grads.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60f972aec23cba5b38b2a041dbd3dad4efb915cd.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why we're going back to the Moon-with or without NASA</h1><p>It was time for the spent rocket to die. So the 2,000kg Centaur upper stage, about the size of a yellow school bus, detached from its spacecraft and began falling toward the Moon six years ago. Soon lunar gravity took hold, tugging the Centaur ever faster toward the Moon's inky black South Pole.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fe5e468f43bdd42aed14e933dbf7e743f307f7de.jpg"></article>]]></description>
