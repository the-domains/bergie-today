            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>SpaceX Is Cribbing From Boeing's 1920s Playbook</h1><p>On March 3, 1919, William Boeing and Edward Hubbard took off in a seaplane from the harbor of Vancouver, British Columbia. They flew 142 miles south to Seattle, where Boeing-a businessman who had previously started a profitable lumber company in Michigan-would soon make a name for himself as one of America's most successful entrepreneurs of the 20th century.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/4ab6d6ba83cdf3e03ea4722ab9ca7548/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.theatlantic.com%2Fassets%2Fmedia%2Fimg%2Fmt%2F2016%2F09%2FP39_5205-1%2Ffacebook.jpg%3F1473181755"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Choose Boring Technology</h1><p>Probably the single best thing to happen to me in my career was having had Kellan placed in charge of me.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>No Sailors Needed: Robot Sailboats Scour the Oceans for Data</h1><p>The Saildrone's carbon fiber sail acts like an aircraft wing. When air passes over it, thrust is created. The sail is stabilized by a counterweight that is placed in front of it and a tab trailing behind it that can automatically make small corrections to make sure it maintains an efficient angle to the wind.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/61ac24ba5e6499ba02329648dabd2e7a/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic01.nyt.com%2Fimages%2F2016%2F08%2F31%2Fbusiness%2F00saildrone-1%2F00saildrone-1-facebookJumbo.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rewriting the Tablet: How Lenovo brought a dream design to life</h1><p>Tablets were supposed to be the future. They were supposed to get us off the desk and away from the laptop, and usher us into a touch-enabled world of productivity and entertainment. A dream of computing where our devices seamlessly blend between activities and go wherever we need them to. But the tablets we know, the iPads and Surfaces of the world, haven’t really lived up to that dream, whether it’s because doing actual work on them is harder than it should be, or because they are barely different than the PCs we’ve used for years.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0e025f8dc55a247d1f6082595351f857e6902737.jpg"></article>]]></description>
