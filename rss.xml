            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google's answer to Facebook Instant Articles is now available on the mobile web</h1><p>Last fall Google announced Accelerated Mobile Pages - an open-source project to speed up the mobile web by changing how web pages are built and displayed. The project, which followed similar efforts from Facebook and Apple, promises to result in pages that load four times as fast and use 10 times less data than traditional pages.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5f4d9dbbd657beeefa0e010b624d1ed182cd39e0.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Plain Text Accounting</h1><p>Accounting data is valuable; we want to know that it will be accessible for ever - even without software. We want to know when it changes, and revision-control it. We want to search and manipulate it efficiently. So, we store it as human-readable plain text.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why I don't want stuff</h1><p>About once a month, someone asks for my mailing address because they want to send me something. They liked something I wrote, and want to send me a gift in return. I'm very thankful, but have to say no. Here's why. I live in a little pre-furnished apartment with no stuff, and I love it this way.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df134327b4103f9004c1359927751fc8bce76e6b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Culture, mathematical models, and Neandertal extinction</h1><p>I am not philosophically opposed to building a mathematical model of Neandertal populations. Some of my best work has involved mathematical model-building. Models have an important place in helping us to understand evolutionary history. But when it comes to understanding Neandertal and modern human interactions, we have had lots and lots and lots of models and few testable predictions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/67cdba0b216e7e2a25c6329c1b82a7bfbb058e2e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Working on the iPad: One Year Later, Still My Favorite Computer</h1><p>Four years ago, I struggled to move from a Mac to an iPad. Today, I only have to open my MacBook once a week. And I wish I didn't have to.  In February 2015, after years of experiments and workarounds, I shared the story of how the iPad Air 2 became my primary computer. The article, while unsurprising for MacStories readers who had been following my iPad coverage since 2012, marked an important milestone in my journey towards being Mac-free.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cc4bd7b385fcaa009436b99eaeac0c4adb32e506.jpg"></article>]]></description>
