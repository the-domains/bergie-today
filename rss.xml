This observation was made just a few days before Mars opposition, when the sun and Mars will be on exact opposite sides of Earth, and when Mars will be at a distance of 47.4 million miles.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d785a3fb7ed3bd49c094d11f8c56d4df3652f447.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is Hyperloop the future of travel?</h1><p>There was a moment, an hour before an event last week, when 30 or so young fresh-faced people stood around their creation and posed for a group photo. They were in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. All around them, reminders of historic innovations that began with research at this legendary college.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fceb3f634fd2d10bc96a4691e18ea86eccce0898.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Come and Twiddle Tek Gear's one handed keyboard</h1><p>Over the years a plethora of keyboard alternatives have crossed the El Reg hardware desk, but none has had the utility, or longevity, of the Handykey Twiddler. This third incarnation has been a decade in the making, and arrived a year late, but with small hands and a willingness to learn it could make wearable computing practical.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/de878ab9a8d5ab068f99f528a2278789adf9e8db.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Google's Allo messaging app is a big step backwards</h1><p>A year ago, when Google began to unwind Google+, it felt like a positive sign for the company's underperforming social efforts. After sinking years into building a product overstuffed with photos, communication tools, link-sharing, and discussions, Google began to shrink them into more manageable tools. The results were largely positive.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/10834985271fad04b54dbfb96c11124ef92ad153.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How I captured and edited the launch and landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9</h1><p>At 1:21am on May 6, 2016, SpaceX continued its run of aerospace brilliance with a night launch of its Falcon 9 rocket, carrying its Japanese communication satellite payload to geostationary orbit. The most spectacular portion of this event was the first successful night landing of the Falcon 9’s first stage onboard their floating platform called “Of Course I Still Love You.” While this was not the first successful landing for SpaceX, it was the first one at sea at night and also one that they predicted to have a high probability of failure due to the dynamics involved with the much higher energy needed to send the satellite to a higher orbit than previous launches</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2e925ed730c521055c4fe5fbc3c77b83359b4dd3.jpg"></article>]]></description>
