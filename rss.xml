            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Humans Who Dream Of Companies That Won't Need Us</h1><p>Like other serious crypto-anarchist visionaries, the 21-year-old Russian Canadian entrepreneur Vitalik Buterin sees the blockchain-the public ledger underlying bitcoin-as a way to liberate us all from inefficiency, cut out the middleman, and make big government and business bow at the free market's feet. What makes his vision different is its scope.</p><img src="http://e.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/1280/poster/2015/06/3047462-poster-p-1-a-the-humans-who-dream-of-companies-that-wont-need-them.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Decoupling Content Management in Drupal</h1><p>Decoupled content management is a new way to look at the process of editing and managing content on the Web. Traditional Content Management Systems tend to tie their users to a built-in content storage and editing interface. The concept of decoupled content management is about a clean separation of concerns between the content repository, the web framework, and the web editing tool.</p><img src="https://archive.org/download/DecouplingContentManagementInDrupal/DecouplingContentManagementInDrupal.thumbs/Movie_000061.jpg"></article>]]></description>
