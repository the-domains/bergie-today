            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In the Beginning was the Command Line</h1><p>A huge stack of accordion-fold paper sat on the floor underneath each one of these glorified teletypes, and miles of paper shuddered through their platens.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Advice for Companies With Less Than 1 Year of Runway</h1><p>The hardest part of dealing with a low runway situation is managing your own psychology.

The first step is to understand exactly how much cash and runway you have.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2480cd811d01860c8ade31b89881cf2f130f56ec.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What's It Like in Space?: Stories from Astronauts Who've Been There</h1><p>Everyone wonders what it's really like in space, but very few of us have ever had the chance to experience it firsthand. This captivating illustrated collection brings together stories from dozens of international astronauts—men and women who've actually been there—who have returned with accounts of the sometimes weird, often funny, and awe-inspiring sensations and realities of being in space. With playful artwork accompanying each, here are the real stories behind backwards dreams, "moon face," the tricks of sleeping in zero gravity and aiming your sneeze during a spacewalk, the importance of packing hot sauce, and dozens of other cosmic quirks and amazements that come with travel in and beyond low Earth orbit.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b1cfc82d60c601fdf34aa8438031eae851821255.jpg"></article>]]></description>
