            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Are cities the new countries?</h1><p>Do big cities have more in common with each other than with the rest of their own countries? Are there meaningful comparisons between cities such as New York, London and Shanghai, rather than between nation states? That is the suggestion of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/678f77995bbeb33a98b76aff7acdbe0feb9eaf8f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Drone swarms will change the face of modern warfare</h1><p>The summer of 2016 will mark a significant moment in the future of air warfare: swarms of US Navy robots will leave the laboratory and be tested in the field. In the past, small numbers of extremely expensive manned aircraft were the norm, but, in the next few years, large numbers of cheap, expendable drones will be deployed in real-world situations. The US Navy's Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology (LOCUST) programme is fusing unmanned aircraft into a swarm, and will demonstrate 30 drones flying together somewhere over the ocean.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bf5cfc1b483071deb19801c17f3ae8b773b9ef3a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>License to (Not) Drive</h1><p>An exclusive look behind the scenes at Google's autonomous car testing center I have backed out of a lot of parking spaces in my life, but today is different. As I adjust the mirrors, fasten the safety belt, turn on the ignition, and put the Lexus RX450h SUV in reverse, I feel the scrutiny of my passengers, professionals who may be skeptical of my ability to control the vehicle.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*-Sq4yMuoBPAFXDx5nRVpKg.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Enhancing images using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)</h1><p>Recently a very impressive paper came out which produced some extremely life-like images generated from a neural network. Since I wrote a post about convolutional autoencoders about 9 months ago, I have been thinking about the problem of how one could upscale or 'enhance' an image, CSI-style, by using a neural network to fill in...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/efd0d73f2dc5e8d8281724b3094613883389eefd.png"></article>]]></description>
