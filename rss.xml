            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Going Serverless: Migrating an Express Application to Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda</h1><p>Amazon API Gateway recently released three new features that simplify the process of forwarding HTTP requests to your integration endpoint: greedy path variables, the ANY method, and proxy integration types. With this new functionality, it becomes incredibly easy to run HTTP applications in a serverless environment by leveraging the aws-serverless-express library.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Around Alone</h1><p>On December 24, 1968, astronaut Bill Anders, lunar module pilot on the Apollo 8 mission-his first and only space flight-took a photograph. In it, the distant blue earth, half in shadow, rises above the gray curve of the moon’s surface. Anders and the other crew members, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, were the first humans to orbit the moon. They were also the first to travel far away enough from our planet that they could look back and see it whole, a blue sphere against a void.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/22033190-0995-4b23-8d48-b696f124d265.jpg"></article>]]></description>

With The Grid, this works by giving your friendly AI designer Molly some guidance through reviewing the designs you’ve received and rating various aspects of them.
Today we rolled out a feature that makes these redesigns smarter.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/03c27f033e10371cdb29608e43355e15a7cff629.png"></article>]]></description>
