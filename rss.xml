            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Get Your Apartment Off the Grid</h1><p>The typical solar PV power installation requires access to a private roof and a big budget. However, wouldn't it be possible to get around these obstacles by installing small solar panels on window sills and balconies, connected to a low-voltage direct current (DC) distribution network?</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/abe40caf-0e5c-4966-acf9-d6d0b3e4a96d.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The slow death of purposeless walking</h1><p>A number of recent books have lauded the connection between walking - just for its own sake - and thinking. But are people losing their love of the purposeless walk? Walking is a luxury in the West. Very few people, particularly in cities, are obliged to do much of it at all.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/126e4027419db698155d1b96a33fc78ff515c40f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bubble Indemnity</h1><p>When Silicon Valley venture capitalists get themselves into image trouble, it's usually because they've been too candid with their low estimate of other people's intelligence. For example, after India recently prevented Facebook from offering free Internet service there, Marc Andreessen suggested in a tweet that the subcontinent might be better off had it remained under colonial administration.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/197c39a7f82aa034460b1be5424fff63c4e93ef4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Perhaps the most important foundational tenet at the big G is a practice called code reviews, or, more precisely, "pre-commit" code reviews. We continue the practice at FullStory and hold it as sacrosanct.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dc279818ac3e5c222953d6b45ebc61b542eb92e3.png"></article>]]></description>
