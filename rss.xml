            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>asCallback: embedding NoFlo graphs in JavaScript programs</h1><p>It has always been easy to wrap existing JavaScript code into NoFlo graphs - just write a component that exposes its functionality via some ports.

This release is important in that it brings the Process API for NoFlo components to general availability, paving way for the 1.x series. We introduced Process API in the 0.7 series last summer, but at that stage it wasn&apos;t deemed good enough for production use.</p><img src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/bergie-iki-fi/a17b8582-fc33-11e5-9826-a722b90913ce.png"></article>]]></description>
