            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Reflections on Programming</h1><p>My perspective on programming has changed quite a bit over the years. Even in the few years since I started this blog I've noticed that I look at programming differently than I used to.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Can we save the open web?</h1><p>The web felt very different fifteen years ago, when I founded Drupal. Just 7 percent of the population had internet access, there were only around 20 million websites, and Google was a small, private company.
