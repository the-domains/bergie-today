            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>NASA Adds to Evidence of Mysterious Ancient Earthworks</h1><p>High in the skies over Kazakhstan, space-age technology has revealed an ancient mystery on the ground. Satellite pictures of a remote and treeless northern steppe reveal colossal earthworks - geometric figures of squares, crosses, lines and rings the size of several football fields, recognizable only from the air and the oldest estimated at 8,000 years old.</p><img src="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/30/science/30KAZAKHSTAN1/30KAZAKHSTAN1-facebookJumbo.jpg"></article>]]></description>

A month later, Apple introduced their own take with their Apple News app, which allows "stories to be specially formatted to look and feel like articles taken from publishers' websites while still living inside Apple's app".</p><img src="http://nytlabs.com/blog/images/particles-head.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Facebook's AI Can Caption Photos for the Blind on Its Own</h1><p>Matt King is blind, so he can't see the photo. And though it was posted to his Facebook feed with a rather lengthy caption, that's no help. Thanks to text-to-speech software, his laptop reads the caption aloud, but it's in German. And King doesn't understand German.</p><img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-551958435-big-1200x630-e1445916830625.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Although it's just a tiny satellite of Saturn-less than one-sixth the size of Earth's moon-Enceladus has become one of the most intriguing bodies in the Solar System.</p><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/543564main_pia07800-full_full-640x320.jpg"></article>]]></description>

I'd read and heard a lot about the law before I ever went back and looked at the seminal, original papers that described it.

It pretty much embodies the idea that while the future might be an overwhelming prospect, it doesn’t have to be frightening, and it doesn’t have to hurt.</p><img src="http://www.scifiideas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/solarpunk.png"></article>]]></description>
