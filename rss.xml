            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Rise of Small Farm Robots - Food is the New Internet</h1><p>Or why the miniaturization of farm machinery will help encourage small, diverse farms. Marilee Foster is not the kind of farmer who makes rash decisions. But when she recently heard about Rowbot, a lawn-mower sized autonomous machine that can fertilize the soil, mulch weeds and sow crops on 50 acres a day, she asked, "How much does it cost?</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a8d6b675f25f690c94b9c86d0633603d40d6c0c2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Escaping the Local Minimum</h1><p>Artificial Intelligence performs gradient descent. The AI field discovers a path of success, and then travels that path until progress stops (when a local minimum is reached). Then, the field resets and chooses a new path, thus repeating the process. If this trend continues, AI should soon reach a local minimum, causing the next AI winter.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ead3cc7b1292148ef788f6bdb6c4ca7ae6ff5c72.png"></article>]]></description>

On a recent afternoon, I waited patiently in a generic conference room with yellow-tinted walls at the Westin Hotel, dressed in a grey suit and a tie, eagerly anticipating the arrival of Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bb2df3b7245c3c2fc2c23816c1e57ef3abe5ed38.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ancient Mars Was Wet and Wild</h1><p>Not only was Mars once a wet planet. New evidence, published today in Nature's Scientific Reports, paints a picture of violent tsunamis as well. Tsunamis on Earth are often caused by earthquakes on the ocean floor or similar events. To an extent, that's also what happened on Mars during both its violent events.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/12f3cdcdbca8e75811a573f4d41def2f01a26c83.jpg"></article>]]></description>

As modern humans began to spread out of Africa roughly 50,000 years ago, they encountered other species that looked remarkably like them - the Neanderthals and Denisovans, two groups of archaic humans that shared an ancestor with us roughly 600,000 years earlier.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/97051156204b5b0f18b4a14ce2a4caeecf902cd2.png"></article>]]></description>

The verdict was reached after three days of deliberation. The verdict in Google's favor ends the trial, which began earlier this month.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/18621c9b145e9cc41e2b51b954311968dd89ed4e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
