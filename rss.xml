The Starliner is scheduled to take its first crewed spaceflight by the end of 2017, effectively resuming U.S.-based flights to space.</p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xj9aea5TKgI/hqdefault.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Implementing a Neural Network from Scratch - An Introduction</h1><p>Get the code: To follow along, all the code is also available as an iPython notebook on Github. In this post we will implement a simple 3-layer neural network from scratch. We won't derive all the math that's required, but I will try to give an intuitive explanation of what we are doing.</p><img src="http://www.wildml.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nn-from-scratch-dataset.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Teaching tomorrow</h1><p>"Because of the increased efficiency of machines, it is getting harder and harder for a human to make a productive contribution to society," says Sebastian Thrun. This is what you might expect to hear from the man who suggested Google's controversial Street View project to photograph the world's roadsides, who developed the company's eerie self-driving cars and who founded the secretive Google "skunk-works" project responsible for Glass, a wearable computer that resembles spectacles.</p><img src="http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20150905_TQD005_0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't Worry, Smart Machines Will Take Us With Them</h1><p>When it comes to artificial intelligence, we may all be suffering from the fallacy of availability: thinking that creating intelligence is much easier than it is, because we see examples all around us. In a recent poll, machine intelligence experts predicted that computers would gain human-level ability around the year 2050, and superhuman ability less than 30 years after.</p><img src="http://static.nautil.us/7061_6495cf7ca745a9443508b86951b8e33a.png"></article>]]></description>

A turn of the head reveals the blackness of deep space behind and above. In front is a table full of toys and brightly coloured building blocks, all of which are resolutely refusing to float away-for, despite his being in orbit, gravity's pull does not seem to have vanished.</p><img src="http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20150829_STD001_0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Binary stars can throw planetary orbits into chaos</h1><p>Planets go through a process known as precession, where the angle of their orbital tracks around a star changes over time. This is a very slow process, requiring many orbits to complete. The part that isn't generally covered in introductory astronomy courses is what happens to precession in binary star systems. For distant companions, the orbit is very long, and thus the change in gravitational influences is slow.</p><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fall_colors_3-640x360.jpg"></article>]]></description>
