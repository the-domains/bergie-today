And that changes what we need to design and build. How we experience content via connected devices - laptops, phones, tablets, wearables - is undergoing a dramatic change....

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2015: The Year in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence</h1><p>The robots didn't really take over in 2015, but at times it felt as if that might be where we're headed. There were signs that machines will soon take over manual work that currently requires human skill. Early in the year details emerged of a contest organized by Amazon to help robots do more work inside its vast product fulfillment centers.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/61d3db59f5c6a7c9ff9f19b992cd14cc13b3f81e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 will be the year of concurrency on the web</h1><p>Since 2009 JavaScript programming on the web has a way to write concurrent programs using shared-nothing threads: Web Workers. But beyond some specialized use cases (e.g. Google Photos uses them for running some filters that need a lot of CPU) they haven't seen any mainstream adoption. This will change in 2016.</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_YAmoYfl5QiSJU_wBhNUQA.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
