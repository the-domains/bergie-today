            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New US space mining law to spark interplanetary gold rush</h1><p>Flashing some interplanetary gold bling and sipping "space water" might sound far-fetched, but both could soon be reality, thanks to a new US law that legalizes cosmic mining. In a first, President Barack Obama signed legislation at the end of November that allows commercial extraction of minerals and other materials, including water, from asteroids and the moon.</p><img src="http://cdn.phys.org/newman/gfx/news/2015/3-illustration.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How Solar Power Could Slay the Fossil Fuel Empire by 2030</h1><p>​ In just 15 years, the world as we know it will have transformed forever. The ​age of oil, gas, coal and nuclear will be over. A new age of clean power and smarter cars will fundamentally, totally, and permanently disrupt the existing fossil fuel-dependent industrial infrastructure in a way that even the most starry-eyed proponents of 'green energy' could never have imagined.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/58a8b11d5edf757543d4397a559da2f1e154712a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Stonehenge may have been first erected in Wales, evidence suggests</h1><p>Evidence of quarrying for Stonehenge's bluestones is among the dramatic discoveries leading archaeologists to theorise that England's greatest prehistoric monument may have first been erected in Wales. It has long been known that the bluestones that form Stonehenge's inner horseshoe came from the Preseli hills in Pembrokeshire, around 140 miles from Salisbury Plain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/739e6cae9052cda56806f5a412efc9345ce9af6b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Manager as Debugger</h1><p>I have observed that the best engineering managers I know are often also great debuggers. Why would this be? What is it about these two tasks that has such an overlapping skill set? A great debugger is relentless in their pursuit of the "why" for a bug.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Big Data's Mathematical Mysteries</h1><p>Quantized: Mathematics Machine learning works spectacularly well, but mathematicians aren't quite sure why. At a dinner I attended some years ago, the distinguished differential geometer Eugenio Calabi volunteered to me his tongue-in-cheek distinction between pure and applied mathematicians. A pure mathematician, when stuck on the problem under study, often decides to narrow the problem further and so avoid the obstruction.</p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/DaubechiesBigData_OBrien_1200-615x344.jpg"></article>]]></description>
