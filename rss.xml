            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Minimalism vs Upgradeism</h1><p>I am the zen minimalist monk. The gods of capitalism look upon my few possessions and weep. There's a place for everything, and everything's in its place. Crucially; there's no room for anything else. I've won. The neoliberal hegemony has lost. Hah! ...oh but I would love to upgrade my headphone amp.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Munich to Venice - the 'Dream Way' - a Review</h1><p>Known as the Traumpfad (Dream Way), the Munich to Venice trek enjoys a huge reputation in Germany. Does it deserve it? Having done it and despite walking 550 km and climbing 22,000m, during the worst Alpine summer in living memory, I can emphatically say that it does.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9b8643e135f9fef94c9e5422d2df30d2/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F-_fpW2Z09D5I%2FVB_ccDvYOWI%2FAAAAAAAAkbM%2FpE_sCP-qa1I%2Fw1200-h630-p-nu%2FP1030419.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>On Linux's 25th anniversary, development has gone corporate</h1><p>The Linux operating system kernel is 25 years old this month. It was August 25, 1991 when Linus Torvalds posted his famous message announcing the project, claiming that Linux was "just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu." But now, Linux is far bigger and more professional than Torvalds could have imagined.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6e262ecd4dba37b7e3efe42898f53b1a/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Flinus-torvalds-800x455.jpg"></article>]]></description>

To me, the most interesting part of Apple's recent press blitz was how in sync everyone was about one point in particular: that the company is unlikely to find another iPhone. Both Tim Cook and Eddy Cue stated this pretty directly in their respective interviews.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e33e7e8c724fb978a44ca5baa861ca24/noop.jpeg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1200%2F1*00wuadtJ4eQCCVvVXZzMVw.jpeg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Page-Based CMS is a Natural Byproduct of the Web</h1><p>The "page-based CMS" is not a bad thing. We try to pretend we don't need to think about pages anymore, but most of the time, attempts to liberate ourselves from the notion of a page is just impractical idealism. Furthermore, the page-based model doesn't really matter that much, in the big picture.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/acfd4ce11f0c2e0f62d49d1a7f12ba86/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fgadgetopia.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fgadgetopia_opengraph.png"></article>]]></description>
