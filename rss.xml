            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Turning Glue Code into Graphs with CocoaFlow</h1><p>Application developers today have a tremendous amount of software at there disposal. Whether it's that great networking library, JSON parsing framework, or an in-house project, the ability to delegate so much logic to tried- and-tested solutions allows for an improved software development process and results in better apps.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What can a technologist do about climate change? A personal view.</h1><p>I'm also only going to directly discuss technology related to the primary cause of climate change (the burning of fossil fuels), although there are technological needs related to other causes ( livestock, deforestation, global poverty), as well as mitigating symptoms of climate change ( droughts and storms, ecosystem damage, mass migrations).</p><img src="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/Images/00-page-header.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Minimalism</h1><p>This is everything I own: A MacBook Pro, an iPad, an unlocked iPhone, seven shirts, two pairs of jeans, two jackets, one coat, one sweater, two pairs of shoes, a suitcase, a backpack, some gym shorts, bathroom stuff, socks and underwear. That’s it. Everything I own can be easily packed into a small suitcase and moved within 30 minutes. There is nothing that I want that I don’t already own. And this is despite owning a six-figure internet business.</p><img src="http://markmanson.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/minimalism2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Most Citizens of the Star Wars Galaxy are Probably Totally Illiterate</h1><p>Not once in any movie does someone pick up a book or newspaper, magazine, literary journal, or chapbook handmade by an aspiring Jawa poet. If something is read by someone in , it's almost certainly off of a screen (and even then, maybe being translated by a droid), and it's definitely not for entertainment purposes.</p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/watto1.jpg?fit=475%2C%209999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C220px"></article>]]></description>

He didn't grow the cool hair until after he was done figuring that stuff out, but by the time everyone realized how good his ideas were, he had grown the hair, so that's how everyone pictures him.</p><img src="http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Munroe-space-doctor-1200x630-1447782889.jpg"></article>]]></description>
