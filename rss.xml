            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Redesigning Waxy, 2016 edition</h1><p>"Redesigning your blog" in 2016 is an anachronism. Like tweaking your Gopher presence or upgrading your ham radio, even talking about blogging feels like a throwback - an exercise in nostalgia for an independent web whose time has passed.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Playing with History: What Sid Meier's Video Game Empire Got Right and Wrong About 'Civilization'</h1><p>The pleasure of Sid Meier’s Civilization series is that it is at once tantalizingly grand and endearingly granular. The game’s approach to the past has always been playful. Abe Lincoln can lead war-bands against Mahatma Gandhi’s phalanxes. The Aztecs can build the first nuclear bomb. Every version of the game begins with the same wide-open promise: a settler, a worker, a few tiles of visible land, and an ocean of darkness—all the ingredients of a world ready to be discovered and made anew.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/3262d82fc91ed81f6e8a4a8b8414616c/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Flongreadsblog.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F10%2Fcivilization-vi-distant-view.png"></article>]]></description>
