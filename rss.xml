            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How I captured and edited the launch and landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9</h1><p>At 1:21am on May 6, 2016, SpaceX continued its run of aerospace brilliance with a night launch of its Falcon 9 rocket, carrying its Japanese communication satellite payload to geostationary orbit. The most spectacular portion of this event was the first successful night landing of the Falcon 9‚Äôs first stage onboard their floating platform called ‚ÄúOf Course I Still Love You.‚Äù While this was not the first successful landing for SpaceX, it was the first one at sea at night and also one that they predicted to have a high probability of failure due to the dynamics involved with the much higher energy needed to send the satellite to a higher orbit than previous launches</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2e925ed730c521055c4fe5fbc3c77b83359b4dd3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Soon We Won't Program Computers. We'll Train Them Like Dogs</h1><p>Before the invention of the computer, most experimental psychologists thought the brain was an unknowable black box. You could analyze a subject's behavior- ring bell, dog salivates -but thoughts, memories, emotions? That stuff was obscure and inscrutable, beyond the reach of science.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8c873187cdee0eebda41318fab78e1a487d0a8b9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The slow death of purposeless walking</h1><p>A number of recent books have lauded the connection between walking - just for its own sake - and thinking. But are people losing their love of the purposeless walk? Walking is a luxury in the West. Very few people, particularly in cities, are obliged to do much of it at all.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/126e4027419db698155d1b96a33fc78ff515c40f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bubble Indemnity</h1><p>When Silicon Valley venture capitalists get themselves into image trouble, it's usually because they've been too candid with their low estimate of other people's intelligence. For example, after India recently prevented Facebook from offering free Internet service there, Marc Andreessen suggested in a tweet that the subcontinent might be better off had it remained under colonial administration.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/197c39a7f82aa034460b1be5424fff63c4e93ef4.jpg"></article>]]></description>
