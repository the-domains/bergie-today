On the opening day of the Somme on July 1, 1916, British guns hurled 250,000 high explosive and shrapnel shells towards German positions. During the beginning of the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917, over 3,000...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a713448b97f7f5f515e4a4edf89bdc66/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fangrystaffofficer.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F07%2Fpoison_gas_attack.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Google says it wants to computers to have an "ongoing two-way dialogue" with their users. This both is and isn't a metaphor.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5,000-year-old pay stub shows that ancient workers were paid in beer</h1><p>In the ancient Mesopotamian city of Uruk, residents enjoyed many benefits of modern life. The city, located in modern-day Iraq, was home to massive ziggurats that would rival any of today's modern skyscrapers for sheer monumentality. People in Uruk exchanged goods for money, played board games, and sent each other letters on clay tablets using a writing system called cuneiform.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/48bfd283968c3353e4fed71e3355aa88/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2F00121754001_h-800x533-640x426.jpg"></article>]]></description>
