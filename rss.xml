            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>For the second time, we are witnessing a new geological epoch</h1><p>11,700 years ago, the Earth suffered a catastrophic climate change. As the ice age ended, sea levels rose by 120 meters, the days grew warmer, and many kinds of plant and animal life died out. But one animal began to thrive more than ever before.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/40800a75d0dc40b54d450e850181f0b999d16aa8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Fleeing violence in Africa and the Middle East, particularly Syria, more than a million migrants crossed by sea into Europe in 2015. Almost 4,000 of them lost their lives in the journey.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/29aea988e1569f2da78c29e9fdad2dd2c5a1fcaf.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Compared to the iPhone a Newton MessagePad looks like a green brick, and I have been accused more than once of stealing the rubberized signature pad from a UPS delivery man.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ba7b3f2ec166c22a72869eafc6129b638a4e851d.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The top A.I. breakthroughs of 2015</h1><p>Progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning has been impressive this year. Those in the field acknowledge progress is accelerating year by year, though it is still a manageable pace for us. The vast majority of work in the field these days actually builds on previous work done by other teams earlier the same year, in contrast to most other fields where references span decades.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aabb541693f80af483de5c196d248e0c298a95d3.jpg"></article>]]></description>
