            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hackers and Heroes: Rise of the CCC and Hackerspaces</h1><p>From its roots in phone phreaking to the crackdowns and legal precedents that drove hacking mostly underground (or into business), hacker culture in the United States has seen a lot over the last three decades. Perhaps the biggest standout is the L0pht, a visible 1990s US hackerspace that engaged in open disclosure and was, arguably, the last of the publicly influential US hacker groups.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a5712e4cd658f849fde05cff12b4d7ca8773ddd4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

For his work on behalf of charities such as World Relief that takes him around the globe, the technology is a godsend.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/da8ed3fdc6886988067689f220734279d88653e7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Deep Space of Digital Reading</h1><p>In A History of Reading, the Canadian novelist and essayist Alberto Manguel describes a remarkable transformation of human consciousness, which took place around the 10th century A.D.: the advent of silent reading. Human beings have been reading for thousands of years, but in antiquity, the normal thing was to read aloud.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fd82133b36e6f43a547478e259ed53550ee5709d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>People Without Electricity Don't Get 8 Hours' Sleep Either</h1><p>Don't blame the lure of a glowing smartphone for keeping you up too late. Even people without modern technology don't sleep the night away, new research says. Members of three hunter-gatherer societies who lack electricity-and thus evenings filled with Facebook, Candy Crush, and 200 TV channels-get an average of only 6.4 hours of shut-eye a night, scientists have found.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4e426aad22fd88797cce57774f36610dce1c3f0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>For the second time, we are witnessing a new geological epoch</h1><p>11,700 years ago, the Earth suffered a catastrophic climate change. As the ice age ended, sea levels rose by 120 meters, the days grew warmer, and many kinds of plant and animal life died out. But one animal began to thrive more than ever before.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9e42bff28186220bead75e59d39a3706147e7268.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Almost 4,000 of them lost their lives in the journey.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/29aea988e1569f2da78c29e9fdad2dd2c5a1fcaf.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Compared to the iPhone a Newton MessagePad looks like a green brick, and I have been accused more than once of stealing the rubberized signature pad from a UPS delivery man.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ba7b3f2ec166c22a72869eafc6129b638a4e851d.png"></article>]]></description>
