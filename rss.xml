            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>U.S. Signals Backing for Self-Driving Cars</h1><p>Federal auto safety regulators on Monday made it official: They are betting the nation's highways will be safer with more cars driven by machines and not people. In long-awaited guidelines for the booming industry of automated vehicles, the Obama administration promised strong safety oversight, but sent a clear signal to automakers that the door was wide open for driverless cars.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/dc4e44b444a21f96740048d91e14c378/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic01.nyt.com%2Fimages%2F2016%2F09%2F20%2Fbusiness%2F20DRIVE%2F20DRIVE-facebookJumbo.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>AI-designed websites have arrived, so what now for WordPress?</h1><p>It still takes hours, days,and weeks to create a well-designed website – and even then, they require far more maintenance than one might expect. In the age of machine learning, space microphones that can hear gravity, and cars that can drive themselves, the process of building a website still seems so unnecessarily clunky, even some 27 years since their invention.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/31e2c98811c4268076e9430a74fd44bc/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwpmastery.xyz%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2016%2F09%2FUsain_Bolt_winning-cropped-1024x476.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ants are destroying your plants by nurturing perfect aphid colonies</h1><p>One of the worst effects of ant infestation doesn't happen inside your house or on your picnic blanket. It takes place in farms and gardens, where many species of ants tend to herds of aphids. These tiny insects are a bane to plants-aphids weaken plants by feeding on their sap, and they sometimes transmit deadly viruses while eating.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/5d7891e25d6ed0a5dee0ef41104b0f37/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.arstechnica.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F09%2Fmegacephala5-XL-800x546.jpg"></article>]]></description>
